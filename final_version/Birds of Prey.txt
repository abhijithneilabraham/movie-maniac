This movie was awful. It's a jumbled mess of missed jokes and shoving girl power and "men are evil' down your throat. There isn't one male in this entire movie that isn't some kind of evil misogynist caricature.You can raise women up without doing that. GOOD movies about strong females make good money because people enjoy them, men as well. But when you go the route of wokeness from the promotion to the actual film, you're going to suffer at the box office....then blame the people you're alienating. It's a clown show.Who is this movie aimed at? Most of the woke crowd don't really want to see it, you alienate your biggest audience and then complain that they don't want to go see it? Make good movies instead of using them to inject your agenda into entertainment.Maybe if they keep losing money they will learn...probably not.The best things about this movie was a CGI Hyena and MEW.






I like women. I like equality.
I don't like idiotic political agendas like "all women good - all men bad".
Besides that, the whole feels cheap and stupid. Margot is an excellent actor so I think this was a missed opportunity to make something cool. They should have learned from the Joker.






What a joke of a movie. Boring slow dull and the plot is daft jumps from one scene to another with no interest. How can any critic that's says this is good be genuine cause there no way they are.






Women beating the **** of evil men for almost 2 hours. If you interested in that concept then this movie is for you.There was no joke in this movie.. none. That alone is an achivement i guess. Creating a movie about one of the funniest DC characters and nobody laughed not even once.Harley was ok, a bit crazy and that's all the positives i can say about this garbage.It felt like a female deadpool wannabe movie but without even a well wrtitten story or good fight scenes, or humor and or a single interesting character to be honest except Harley...
Yep, even black mask was garbage.
Straight comparison to suicide squad : this movie's total mess..Horrible script, lack of characters development even there are some attempts yet miserably failed, wasted main villain potential, and so on..Now Wonder Woman 1984 has a tough burden to redeem this junk.






I really, really, really wanted to love this movie, as I adore Margot Robbie, but unfortunately Harley Quinn without the joker is just a joke. This movie was so incredibly dull I found myself dozing off throughout, which is very abnormal for me. The plot is a bit all over the place, the characters lack any depth, and even with Margot Robbie's great acting, I still found myself uninterested in what actually happens to Harley Quinn. I think DC really missed the mark by not making a Jared Leto Joker and Harley Quinn movie, as they had great chemistry and could have been really dynamic together if given the chance.






Train wreck of a movie. Robbie looked like she was trying to be an extra in My Name Is Earl. Seriously, Jamie Presley would have done a way better job. The only thing that was ok about this film was the soundtrack. Best way to describe this movie would be mix Deadpool, Boondocks Saints, Suicide Squad and Charlie's angels together, mix in some really really bad acting and you get this gem






This movie should've been called, "Harley Quinn and the birds of prey" or "Harley Quinn and ... (insert any name here)" because this is not a team based movie at all, it mainly focus on the character of Harley Quinn - sadly not in a meaningful way - and her fight against what can be described as a faded image of Black Mask.I'm OK with making a movie far off the original animations and comic books in what seems to be a shadowed completely different characters who only share their names from the original adaptation but even considering this fact in this movie it's still considered a huge let down on all aspects, from the shallow silly plot to the corny acting by everyone specially "Margot" and the the sexual orientation twists that turns almost every lead male and female character into either bisexual or gay while leaving the rest of the minor male characters to look like jerks which is no more than a sad attempt for female empowerment movie, not to mention the too much colorful scenes and cheesy directing throughout the whole mess.There are many huge missed opportunities here that could've turned this into an amazing piece of art, I believe it was deliberately missed by the childlike script and performance by all adding the all over the place sets decorations and directing.I understand that a Harley movie must be colorful and chaotic but there's a huge difference between artistic anarchy and this mess which feels it was directed by a crazy extravagant fashion designer! The movie had its very few moments though, for example the fight scene in the evidence room which I believe is considered the level that the whole movie should've been developed upon or even darker! not too girly and childish like this one.Harley Quinn is a very dangerous character, sometimes even sometimes more crazy and sadistic than the joker, an unstable yet funny lady in a dark way and what was represented in this film had nothing to do with Harley's character, I don't think this movie will be enjoyed by most fans of Harley Quinn or DC generally, I for one sure didn't enjoy it this much, my opinion is this, "Margot" will never be a true to heart Harley Quinn... she doesn't look the same, she doesn't feel the same and sure as hell doesn't sound the same.Just like people admired "Jack Nicholson" for being the Joker, No one knew back then that there will be "Heath Ledger" and "Joaquin Phoenix" to rule the role on their own way and the same goes for Harley, I believe nerds drool over "Margot" because they didn't see any better versions yet and I'm sure if the role was given to someone else who is close to the original Harley it'll dazzle everyone. I recommend if DC decided to use "Margot" again at least ask her to go learn from "Arleen Sorkin" how to say "Puddin" or "Mr. J" properly and for f's sake just give her a bigger adult oversized mallet for some wild skull crushing instead of that childish toy she had to hit people with!






The plot is so simple that everything that happens, happens for the sake of the plot.Nothing is interestingNothing is newNothing is creativeEven the action is dull and boringThe acting could not save the boredom of this movie !!!






Target demographic (12-17 year old girls)Movies rating (R18+)Whoever thought this was a good idea definitely needs to reconsider. Your own audience couldn't see it.It's easily the worst of the 8 DC films to date. You want female empowerment watch Wonder Woman.






Margot Robbie is pretty awesome as Harley Quinn however even with that, this movie is one step up from unwatchable. The plot is all over the place, the dialogue is horrible, the characters other than Harley Quinn are inconsequential, and basically the producers are just spitting in the eye of anybody who has been a fan of the comics. There were a couple good laughs and a couple good fight scenes but otherwise this really was nothing but a loud, garish Suicide Squad spin-off. I'd be all for a real DC Birds of Prey movie, but this film should not even have had that name in the title.






I was one of the many fans of Margot Robbie who was wowed by her initial performance as Harley Quinn and looked with anticipation for the character's return. I never imagined the pathetic sequel that has been released. EVERYTHING IS TERRIBLE! The Director and the Scriptwriter who created this stink bomb should be banished from Hollywood and Margot should have held out for a better script instead of accepting her payday. Very disappointing.






They were most likely warner bross bots trying to pull this garbage by ears from pits of low-scoresAbout 10.000 watchers (not counting lunatics/bots with 10/9 stars) though this movie is good or very good.Makes me wonder. Do people REALLY think this is good? or is this some kind of leming rush combined with lack of proper sense?This movie preys on all people affected by the twisted feminist ideology.It's just bad.






It's your regular feminist anti male propaganda. That is literally a spoiler. Don't waste yoru money on this crap. Wait a minute .... you didn't. It bombed.
Highly disappointing! Margot Robbie in my opinion wasn't at her best as before. Her voice work seemed off & body language seemed restricted & constrained. I felt I got what the director & writer had in their imagination, but it wasn't what came out. The BEST THING about this movie was Mary Elizabeth Winstead's appearance and performance. Evan McGregor was flawless too. Other than them, it felt like every character was under utilized. Most scenes were either hurried or trimmed abruptly. Music at some places was really good and really boring at others. Imo, the points where music was very good needed to be louder. Action didn't excite too much and the props used for that seemed to come out of nowhere. This team had tremendous potential if the story could have been told differently and action scenes were tweaked at some places. With some more inter character tension, this could have been a blockbuster. Hate to say this, but highly disappointing.






Before we saw this movie, my son told me that there were lots of 1/10 reviews on IMDb from people who hadn't even seen the film. Well, here's a 1/10 review from someone who has.Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn reminds me a lot of Lori Petty in Tank Girl (1995), another comic book film that really ground my gears. Like Petty's character, every quirky mannerism and snarky comment by Harley got right on my tits, as did her horrible fashion sense. In addition to Robbie's diabolical performance, we get equally obnoxious turns from Rosie Perez as a tough cop, Ella Jay Basco as an annoying pick-pocket, and Ewan McGregor as camp crime boss Roman Sionis, plus an absolutely pointless tribute to Marilyn Monroe, lots of dumb, supposedly amusing captions, a tiresome self-aware voice-over, and a horrible CGI hyena.Director Cathy Yan (who?), working from a charmless script by Christina Hodson, is unable to do anything interesting with the admittedly wafer-thin plot, which can be boiled down to just a handful of words: "everyone is looking for a diamond".A muddled, noisy, gaudy mess, full of poorly constructed action scenes and goofy humour that falls flat on its face, Birds of Prey is possibly the worst film I have seen at the cinema in recent months. And I saw Cats and Bombshell (another Margot Robbie disaster).






The script is horrible and directing and casting like a B movie gone bad. Margot is only decent character but even her talent can't hold this action flick from floundering. It's basically a total rip off of Deadpool but without directing or writing panache. At some point Studios will realize making Male action movies but with chicks does not work unless the script is solid and has some flair. Birds of Blaise. A 4 for Margot acting.






The DC universe is soooo serious about itself and dramatic while Marvel learned that a soft shoulder and humor works wonders. We have only a few kinda sorta good films in DC but this is far from one of them. Theme still comes off of SUICIDE SQUAD which is quirky different fun but an acquired taste. Not bad. So I can survive violent fun films but here ...... wow, first 20 minutes and I walked out of the theatre. That bad. When the punishment by a villain makes one really want to upchuck the popcorn? Way bad taste. Trust me, you'll know it when you see it. So here is 20 minutes worth of bad and if you want 30, go for it.






This was such an incredible waste of potential. The casting sucked, the set design sucked and the dialogue was cringe.






Some of the action scenes were okay. Nothing special I was really hoping to see something worth watching. This is quite a disappointment. A lot of hype as usual What can I say? I'm just hoping when Venom comes out. I'll have something to enjoy. I don't recommend of this one.






I haven't walked out of a film in 30 years, until tonight. About 45 minutes was all I could take. There literally wasn't a single scene that wasn't absolutely stupid in every way.I just there squirming, feeling so embarrassed for Margo. Please do not waste your money on this awful film.






I was really hoping to have a good time. Instead, when I wasn't winching from the language I was reeling from the violence. It is unnecessarily disturbing. Not exactly graphic but considering my 11 year old daughter was really waiting to see this movie-that ain't gonna happen-it's needlessly gruesome. This movie is too silly to take seriously and too serious to politely excuse as "it's just a movie, lighten up!" Almost everyone is horribly miscast except Margot Robbie. She's great! The writing is bad. The sets are bad! Man, the clothing is even bad, and I never notice such things. The villain (I won't say his name) from the comic book has been emasculated to the point of being more insulting than threatening. The implication is that he's a gay, psychopathic killer; if that's true someone at DC needs to learn how to make their gay psychopaths more ruthless (they missed the mark on Lex Luther in Batman vs Superman too). I'm sure should you see this objectively you'll find way more bad stuff to criticize than me.






While Margot Robbie is a good Harley Quinn, the character was not given enough arc. The plot was predictable and mainstream, especially due to lack of a strong antagonist. The main antagonist, played by Ewan McGregor, was not developed and hence did not add significant value to the plot story. Although some of the fight scenes were entertaining, the film as a whole was truly forgettable.






I really wanted to like this movie. Love Margot, love Ewan. So many positive things. Amazing budget, great actors, awesome source material.Still very bad. Actors could not fix this script and plot. Very poor. Wish this was special and not cheapened by typical Hollywood decisions.






If you like Suicide Squad, this is for you. If not, this is a hard pass. Don't even bother.The good:
Harley Quinn is perfectPerformances are goodit's visually pleasingThe bad:
For being R-rated, the violence feels neuterednot comic accurate at the least, infact it's a huge "f u" to the comicsit's not original, it's just a gender-bent version of Deadpool 2The ending isn't deservedThe story is bland, sloppy, and allover the placeCostumes looked cheap






Add another Box Office Bomb to the long list of Feminist Man Hating Duds. As a woman I have the right to call out This Woketards. We dont want reboots,reduxs, gender swap, man hating movies. We want more movies like Salt, Original Aliens, Original Terminator, Resident Evil, Silence of The Lambs, and other movies that provide a strong female lead or character who ist trying the be a FemiNazi. Is it that hard. No wonder why people are turning against the lame movies being put out. I hope Hollywood continues to Go Woke, cause the will be Broke soon.Another Review From A
Proud Woman of Color.






If u want to watch a really bad movie, I recommend this movie.






This could have been such a good movie! The movie took a few steps too many into the woke space. While some of the elements fit in well with the theme, it becomes tiring if the same message is constantly being repeated over and over and over. It simply spoils the movie






I made an account just to write this review. I gave the extra star because the tin can the popcorn came in was the highlight of the movie for design and colour.
As for the movie, truly abysmal, complete and utter waste of time. Unmitigating and utter shambles of a story line and very uninspired to say the least. I am truly traumatised from ever going to the cinema again!






With badly driven character arcs and nonexistent plot, "Birds of Prey" is a directionless mess. Instead of showing you a fun and interesting story, they would rather talk you through expository dialogue and narration. Beneath this pile of wasted potential is a sadly missed opportunity for an interesting story about some of DC's most interesting characters. The most compelling part of the movie for me was Hunteress, who had less screen time than an adolescent pick-pocket. But the best part of the film isn't even about the film, but the critics response. Even the top critics, whose job it is to judge movies by their story and characters, say that the fighting was so cool that it makes it a good movie. So then, why isn't Green Lantern considered a good movie? Man of Steel? Suicide Squad? These "critics" are either to dumb to realize an awful movie when they see one, or they're afraid to criticize movies because of the backlash they might get.In conclusion: Don't make the same mistake I did and waste your hard earned money on this two hour long mood swing.






Big Margot Robbie fan and was super pumped for this film yet It was easily the worst movie I've seen in years. Editing was all over the place, every joke fell flat, dialog was cringe, and some terrible acting by the cop lady and the young Asian girl. The high end visuals ewan's job as black mask were the loan positives in this disaster.






Just a total mess of a film,bad script
no real story ,bad acting ,the wrong actors for some of the parts, no real jokes in the film,some ok action bits but the films just all over the place it was terrible.has to be the worst D C film to date .






Having watched this movie just last night, and having some time to reflect on it, I can honestly say that this movie is not worth the time to watch. The acting is average for the most part, the story is well below average, the whole movie is just average. Not to mention that it hinges on the appeal of all DC Universe fans while at the same time completely aiming directly at teenagers.I didn't have high hope's that Birds of Prey was going to be anything other than an average movie so set my expectations pretty low. This is a Warner Bros movie after all and when it comes to the DC universe, their movie releases are very much like a Yoyo of good to downright awful. But what we get here is a spinoff movie that does nothing to convince you that it was even set in the world of DCU, let alone the world of Batman. Seriously, if you took away the obvious uniqueness of some of the characters, removed their names and called this anything that infers a crime caper, you would never have know. But to make this as painless as possible for those on the fence as to whether they should watch this or not, I can sum this movie up fairly quickly and easily.***Spoiler time***Harley gets dumped.
Harley gets drunk.
Harley tries to go it alone.
Harley becomes a target without the Joker's protection.
Harley gets caught by Roman Sionis (Black Mask) who is after a diamond.
Said diamond is seemingly a key to ruling the criminal underworld.
A kid steals said diamond when she pickpockets Victor Zsasz.
Harley makes a deal to retrieve said diamond to keep herself alive.
Harley finds kid.
Harley feels sorry for kid.
Harley tries to keep kid alive.
Harley keeps kid alive.
Kid kills (gratuitously) Black Mask.
Harley and kid run away with diamond.
The end.***Spoilers end***
I generously gave this a 4/10 purely because some of the visual effects were pretty good, Margot Robbie (Harley), Ewan McGregor (Roman Sionis/Black Mask) and Chris Messina (Victor Zsasz) acting skills were keeping the film alive and some of the action scenes were mildly amusing. Other than that there is nothing really to redeem this movie. Think of Suicide Squad having an (almost) all star cast to keep it mildly entertaining and you will have an idea of the quality, or lack there of, that Birds of Prey has to offer. Which isn't much.
The acting was good, most of the actors gave it their all, but the film was just so UGLY. Gave me a headache just looking at it. Also the dialogue was so cringe worthy. It wanted to sound and look edgy, but ended up being a complete mess of a film. Feel sorry for a character with such a strong fan base.






Birds of PreyI must say I was really bored from the start.What was good,The action sequences were well planned.The stylingWhat was badA paper thin story about of really empty violent criminal that derived pleasure from hurting people. Why is this entertaining.The same scenes kept repeating and repeating it was beyond predictable.Just no character development and some strange pc nod to girl power.I really don't see why this movie was made at all and who was the target audience.






I wanted to enjoy this movie, but I couldn't. Bad screenplay, bad CGI and... no story. Waste of money and time at the cinema.






But thats the only thing positive i can say about this
Looks like dc needed easy money so they used every graphic fught scene they could, included visual effects from dance movies
No storyline whatsoever
I almost fell asleep in the cinema
Not comparable to well known dc movies like wonderwoman, joker, batman, suicide squad etc
Its really bad






Wow ! Harley was the only solid character in the whole movie and 80% of the movie was her explaining who everyone else was because they made a total $×&t show of the rest of them! Every other character was a complete 180 off the source material (Harley isn't perfect either but at least the accent was there this time) and a 1000% worse... I'm so glad I didn't pay to see this, a friend paid because I refused to go and I was right to. Whoever wrote this deserves to burn, It was at least an actual story unlike Joker.
I hope the new suicide squad is better(it should be due to James Gunn) The least they could have done was make an actual Birds of Prey using the real characters and give Harley Quin her own movie...DC movies are just garbage(aside from Aquaman and Wonder woman) it was bad just avoid it.
I actually paused Winter Soldier to go be offended for an hour and 40 min....DC needs to stick to television and animation and leave the movie business to Marvel.
On that same note tho Marvel TV isn't so good so no I'm not just saying this because I'm a marvel only fan, Batman is My favorite comic character aside from the punisher so yes I wanted to cry when they cast the new Shatman which is what they should call it....Now I'm gonna go cry myself to sleep.






I'll just go straight for it, if you're going to downvote this review for defending a genuinely entertaining violent film, i get that. Literally just WATCH THE MOVIE! This movie is anything but a "men are trash" movie. It's a fun flick about a heist where it's all knives at eachothers throats. Genuinely formulaic at times, sure, but that's practically a given for these types of films! Margot Robbie gave a fantastic performance as the Quinn herself, and the side characters had their moments as well! Gotta give a FAT shoutout to McGregor for his role. He brought just as much flame and fire as Margot gave her role. Go ahead and do yourself a favor. This is a good ass time to watch!






Terrible movie. Another chance for Hollywood Liberals to charge you money to sit in front of their movie and be brain washed. Not worth seeing. Save your money for a real story told well and without the feminist hue to it.






Birds of Prey: and the Fantabulous Emancipation of one Harley Quinn, is a movie I had high hopes for but it fell flat. I will start off this review with the positive aspects first such as: Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn was a great casting and continues to be where I think she gives a better performance then her one in Suicide Squad, and Ewan Mcgregor plays a decent version of Black Mask. The use of colours and costumes I thought were great and I found some moments of entertainment through some of its action sequences.However, This film has a lot of problems, most of the performances in this film are very shoddy, especially from Rosie Perez who is a walking cliche' as Renee Montoya (and I know that's what they were going for but it just doesn't work}, and Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Huntress who gives us some very cringey at times acting, and I think some of this has something to do with the screenplay which I also think is average at best. The humour that they're going for doesn't work at all I chuckled maybe once, and it was the same for my theatre. They also butchered Victor Zsasz which I found extremely disappointing as I was looking forward to his inclusion in the DCEU, the way he was portrayed was nothing like how he is in the comics and it seems like he is just trying to be some knock off version of the Joker. Also why is the film titled Birds of Prey? This is a Harley Quinn Movie, just like the trailers the Birds of Prey are barely in it and when they were they had small glimpses of being cool characters but for the most part they were some of the most cliched early 2000's era superhero characters I have seen since that era.Overall, I found Birds of Prey to be a disappointment I came into this film very optimistic but got let down, due to the fact that this films writing was just plain bad. If Margot Robbie's and Ewan Mcgregor's performances weren't as great as what they were with the nice compliments of the characters costumes it would have been completely boring and cliched garbage.






BIRDS OF PREY...wtf DID I WATCHED????DON'T THE they KNOW ITS BASED ON COMICS NOT YOUR BITTER DIVORCE ! 10 HOURS OF MY LIFE I WILL NEVER GET BACK.. WELL IT FELT LIKE THAT BLOODY LONG AND BORING ANY WAY.. ps the writer did a great Job writing Bumblebee.. Enjoyed that one ..






I did not like Suicide Squad which might invalidate my opinion for some people, but I feel it's important to add. This film beats it out by miles. I would watch SS a thousand times if it could erase Birds of Prey from my memory. It was awfully paced, poorly acted, irritatingly written, an overall nightmare.If you can enjoy this movie I guess good for you? But I have no idea why someone would walk out of the theater without feeling like you wasted two hours or just being frustrated.






Its just as the trailer looked like ... a wannabe deadpool. Only good thing ist Margot's performance.
A missed chance...






If you are not driven by the imperative need of understanding precisely what is happening in your movie, you might enjoy this psychedelic mix of disjointed cool visuals, great music, firecrackers, fragments of good acting...
Birds Of Prey is a mess presented in a messy way, it hardly holds together as a story but it offers moments of fun.






I am not sure what is this movie. Sort of a suicide squad, but even worse, mixed with joker. All the movie could be summarized in two ideas: Margot Robbie and the boring woke message "all men are bad". A movie for the glory of Margot, in which all the other characters are mere plain comparsas. And, in this sense, it works: Margot Robbie is good, she do it very well and she is all the movie. She is fantastic.
The villain here are all the men. Period. McGregor do it well as a well trained mercenary of acting.
The female supremacy messages are beginning to be tiresome, folks. I didn't remember Ripley or Connor needed to highlight their badassness in an overall men sucks ideology.
Apart of that message (which is not as exaggerated as some say in their comments, but it is there) the movie is formulaic, predictable, messy and, probably one of the worst DC movies...
If you are a woke teenager in the age range 12-19 years, probably you will deeply enjoy it. If you are a fan of DC comics, you will see how far is this Harley Quinn from the comics, but you will enjoy the few coincidences. If you like DC movies, maybe you will enjoy it with a lot of popcorn. If you do not feel identified by any of these categories, save your time and money.






Within just 3 minutes I hated this film. The highpitched voice of Margot Robbie (like Mickey Mouse) just constantly annoying, extreme violence without any need (faces of victims were cut off, leg bones broken by jumping on them etc. - all of that also within just the first 5 minutes of the flick), vomiting, snot, peeing ... it was as if the producers tried to 'shock', annoy and put off the viewers with as many cliches and generally annoying/disgusting/dehumanizing scenes possible. I asked my friends how they like the film - general shaking of heads. We decided that our time is too valuable to watch this crap, gave it 10 minutes more but than left.This is what I call thievery of time and money. Horrible.






Sorry, but i absolutely hated it! A really bad comedy for kids.






Suicide Squad was a terrible movie, pitiful actually. So why would we watch or like this? Just because people saw suicide squad doesnt mean it was good or that they liked it. This movie looks like a pile of rainbow sherbet, the color scheme alone will repel viewers and the costumes are unrecognizable. I wont get into the feminist aspect because im not allowed...






A dud from Warner Bros. The best thing about suicide squad was Robbie's performance but this vehicle is a disservice to the potential that was there. Robbie does her best but the direction, script and editing are not at the requisite level. An interesting character poorly treated by a very lacklustre script. Disappointing.






There are awful movies and there are annoying movies. This movie in a rare combination is both. It wants to be Deadpool so bad. Only HQ's voice is unbearable. It jumps around and doesn't know what it is. Whoever edited this movie should be fired. It's so noisy. Like nails on a chalk board. The story is terrible. HQ telling them story makes it so convoluted and unwatchable. It's made for people with A.D.D because HQ clearly can't hold a real conversation.
In Gotham Victor Zazz is funny and psychotic. In this he's a lunatic who cuts himself. The story builds up to a 10 min scene and then completely abandons that as Harley abandons the crew. I died laughing when the singer blows them away with her voice. Are you kidding me? I ended up hating Harley Quinn by the end. I felt bad for Ewan McGregor. It must have been a cash grab because he probably filmed his scenes in less than a week. You think well maybe there will be a good fight with him at the end. Nope dead in 30 seconds from a grenade. Once again every man is stupid and incapable and every woman is bulletproof and unstoppable. This movie was made for teenage girls with ADHD but is rated R for some reason. This is the worst movie I've seen since Open Water and is definitely the most annoying. It honestly hurt my head. It was like cats fighting, or bats, or sleeping in a machine shop. I never thought I wouldn't like Margot Robbie in a movie but she couldn't save this. DC you will never be Marvel. Black Widow will be amazing as a female led movie. This was trash. Absolute garbage.
I WAS REALLY HOPING I'D LIKE THIS BUT I ENJOYED MY MICRO NAPS DURING THE FILM BETTER... THE STORY LINE IS ALL OVER THE PLACE AND THE CHARACTERS ARE UNLIKABLE WITH THE EXCEPTION OF HQ... UNFORTUNATELY THE ONLY PREY IN THIS MESS WAS ME






First part of the BoP, that feels like 2/3 of the movie, is just bunch of character introduction, flashbacks, retelling stories. The antagonist is lame and boring. Action scene isn't exciting, full of slow-mo scenes, Harley just spins too much it seems unnecessary. Dinah's scream is just out of nowhere.
What an absolute waste of money w the stupidest script. Of all the talented writers that must be out there - why would you choose to produce an obviously idiotic story like this ?? I just don't get it. You have this chance of putting something out there of value - all this sweet Hollywood money and this is the best you can come up with ?? Really ??






Sorry i went to cinema to watch. Very few good fight scenes. The girls had no chemistry and was awkward. The story telling was a bit annoying.






It's trying to be a Deadpool movie but it failed Miserably. There are some good action sequences but overall they are nothing like the Birds of Prey. For being a comic book movie it definitely fails. It's a messy movie overall.






Suggestion, when doing a comic book film using beloved characters make sure to land those characters. You can deconstruct them all you like, but if the heart isn't there you get this instead of "the joker".There is no Birds of prey, at least none recognizable from their source material counterparts. Robbie is not Harley, her 90's trashy grunge gender studies cousin maybe, but not Harley. When a cartoon does better than a multi-million dollar film, you've failed.Over the top man hating new wave feminism and alphabet "representation" for no reason. Action is not believable. Writing is atrocious. Editing is frenetic.If you hated Suicide squad, welcome to its jealous over achieving sister.






In case Hollywood execs have been hiding under a rock for the past few years, movies that come off as blockbusters, but are just there to shove an agenda down the viewers throats, are always a huge flop. Going all the way back to 2016 with the female Ghostbusters, then the all female Oceans 8, then moving in to Force Awakens and the awful Last Jedi and Rise if Skywalker. These failures insist they are good, and should be watched and praised by everyone simply because the cast is female. The cast and crew refuse to accept how bad their movies are, and insist on its success, despite opinions from anyone who's seen them and disagree. Those of whom are simply labeled women-hating trolls.Birds of Prey is no different. While Kathleen Kennedy is insisting on a female director for the next Star Wars film, as this film had, her sexist persona should be taught that gender, race, political identity and religion should have no say in how the movie is going to perform. Movies are rated by quality, plain and simple. If you have a good script, good acting, good directing, good producing and good editing, the movie will always do well. None of which can be found in Birds of Prey, let alone pretty much all female led films lately.While Hollywood and the left are insisting on pushing straight, strong male leads out of the way in order to push their narrative of strong females, they in turn, sacrifice their films. In other words, they're simply cutting off their noses to spite their face.When is Hollywood going to learn that these movies do not embrace strong females, nor make successful films. They ruin them. If you want to see strong female lead characters in movies, go watch Aliens, Terminator 2 and Underworld. Those were good movies, with very likeable and admiral female leads, that didn't shove their narrative all in your face.Birds of Prey is another strong female film failure, with awful acting and non-believable characters. The film, as so many others have done, purposefully make the male characters weak and stupid simply to embolden the females. The story is a joke and the dialogue is horrible.Hollywood, please stop giving SJWs the reins to how movies should be. They don't make money, and they're constant failures, and the country is suck of them.
There are two ways to look at the film - as a stand alone film or as a Harley Quinn film.Getting the latter out of the way, it's not a Harley Quinn film, nor is the awful Suicide Squad. This is a character loosely based on one of the most liked characters in DC comics. But that's not an issue as I don't believe it's meant to be the same character.As a stand alone film, it's ok. It's trying very hard to be Deadpool in many parts and falls flat at that.
It's also not all that fun though it tries desperately hard to be "fun" with the colours and sounds and attempted jokes throughout which in a lot of scenes back fires. Ewan McGregor is also not all that great in the film, it's hard to understand his motive, he seems to have a different motive in every scene.Warner Brothers has completely wasted their own properties with DC Films really, if they make a sequel to this how does it fit with Suicide Squad? Why would they make a sequel to either, the audiences didn't walk out screaming for more, nor or either memorable. Add this to the long list of poor, disconnected DC films, it's a mess.
The saving grace is Wonder Woman which is amazing and deserves better from WB.






Women against men, men are evil, women, the good, wins.
The movie was unforgettable, thought it would get better it just got stale. The script is terrible, every aspect of the movie failed to deliver. If it was not for Margot Robbie doing a good job playing Harley Quinn. I would of walked out of the theater. Don't believe the hype skip this one!






Just got out of a 6pm showing Thursday night. Overall disappointing, all the jokes fell flat except 2 where the majority of the audience laughed. The fights are all slow mo where the guy flips, seriously they overdid it. It was just bland. They screwed up Huntress as little as she was in it, they made her a "bro" kinda dimwit.It was just overall bland. I think it'll make money because they're hardcore pushing the girl power all men are bad in the movie but they dropped the ball. OG Suicide Squad is better and that's saying something.






Another feminist but poorly focused film, which aims to give a message of empowerment by putting all men as unscrupulous bad guys who want to hurt very angry women with no sense of humor, and with the power to beat them up. The same happened with the last version of Charlie's Angeles, but at least there was a more interesting plot and more twists in it.
I believe that the opportunity to create a film that really conveyed the message to young women that feminism is not to be against men, but to seek equal opportunities, was lost. And I emphasize "young women" because for me this film must have been made with teenagers in mind, because it is not only lost in giving radical messages, but in the constant use of the f* word, that evidences more the bad script, as well as in cruel violence that is unnecessary. And also it is a boring movie, which fails to catch me as audience and itself believes to be more important than it is. I don't know why Ewan McGregor's work has been praised, if all he does is interpret the bad bad guy. In fact, his character, like the other Birds of Prey that are not Harley Quinn, has no development and is a stereotype.
At least towards the end there is a good action scene in a car, and Margot Robbie is nice, but too bad she is at the service of such a mediocre film.






There is a "car chase" at about 25mph, a fight in a bouncy castle baseball bats v guns/knives. Disjointed narrative, McGregor is about as intimidating as cornflakes. It doesn't know who it's audience is. Mercifully short.






Caught the late morning showing of this film with the family as we all loved Margot Robbie as Harley in the Suicide Squad film and everyone came away hating this movie. The story was very uninspiring, the violence and fight scenes with a couple of exceptions were poorly done and it simply skipped around too damn much trying to explain it's terrible story.The half dozen others who were in the theater were obviously as disappointed as we were from their very loud comments while leaving pointing out obvious flaws with the canon of Harley and her power set in being tranquilized so easily when she is virtually immune to toxins and chemicals ( I had to look it up make sure they were right and they were).Whether all of its flaws are the result of the usual studio interference of the DC movies or because Robbie was a producer of the movie is for others to determine. All I really know is this was one of the few times I can really say the cost of going in time and money was a complete waste.
Hollywood is becoming very tiresome and this garbage doesn't help matters. When are female actors to be be given roles where they do not have to try to out do male physically violent characters ? Not only preposterous a la the last Terminator junk, but here also the endless' we can be tougher than you' rubbish is pumped out as if to show " see we do give women good roles"I know it is easy to blame the screeching of the metoo movement partially for this state of affairs , but please filmakers grow a set and cast women in good roles where they are the best fit and not splatter every film with miss-cast actresss just to try to show that you are being inclusive. Currently the casting is demeaning to absolutely everyone.
I wasn't drawn into the story nor felt connected to any of the characters. All of the characters portrayed lacked substance and depth as did the overall plot. It all seemed like a bunch of caricatures moving things across a drawn out, boring, no surprises script. The lead character is portrayed as shallow, having gone looney over her falling in love with the Joker. The back story of her life doesn't add up to where she ends up in present time - stealing, killing, anarachist. The other characters pop up as anti-hero's but again a lack of depth and no back story other than the Black Canary to give a sense of connection to their motives. The scene where the BC lets her vocals loose and exhibits a super power comes out of nowhere and only happens once. I still don't understand how she got that power but maybe the editing took out that part. Overall, I felt as if I wasted two hours of precious time, and unless you are a die-hard Harley fan, I highly recommend avoiding this movie.
Seriously cant think of anything good to say about this movie. action scenes looked badly staged. plot is paper thin. this continued pandering to the woke left has killed what had the potential to be truely awesome movie. sure i get its good to be diverse and all inclusive be its continually being forced down out throats and only alienates those of us who just want to escape for a couple of hours and want to be entertained. this fails on every front






Margot is excellent as Harley Quinn and charming. But for me the film cannot be sustained. And the new characters in the plot didn't interest me. A cliché film, a noisy soundtrack that doesn't fit with the scenes and a plot with nothing to unfold. Some moments even sounds similar to the second Deadpool movie






Where is DC going? I am a die hard DC "Superman, JL" fan, loved that DC are in the race with Marvel but COME ON MAN, what the hell is this movie, it is very close to w low budget movie 😳😷🤧😭😢






I was one of the few people who liked Suicide Squad. And sure there won't be a Will Smith Deadshot again.. or the awesome El Diablo. For that matter, this film has no Batman or Joker. The characters are all brought together quickly/ in a rush but oh well. Harley Quinn gets annoying. And fast. Even from the opening sequence I was already wishing for less of her. So to give you something that seems like praise- If Joker was a ONE then this is a FOUR. Still wouldn't watch it again.






I am a huge fan of Suicide Squad and Margot nailed Harley Quinn. So if Barb Wire and a really bad circus had a baby it would be Birds of Prey. The cast had no magic and the fight scenes were just plain ridiculous. I know this wasn't supposed to be an academy award movie but I expected a lot more from the writers and directors. Save your money and if your really bored and are tired watching grass grow rent it and watch it while you play on your IPad. Sorry, Margot save your career and stay away from any sequels down this road.






Margo was AMAZING as Harley! Lit up the screen and impeccable acting, the fight scene were unique and well shot. The rest... BORING! I would much rather have seen a plot about Harley's transformation or her and the jokers relationship... But a girl power movie is just boring! The whole thing was centered around beating up bad guys and how you don't need a man. Just boring in the end... Go woke go broke I guess! It's just sad because the movie was really well done and could've been so fun and awesome but it just had a terrible plot!






Birds of Prey: And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn is a new action crime film from the DC film series. This film is directed by Cathy Yan the director of Dead Pigs.Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) and her partner the Joker split up in the film. Harley now has to stand up single-handedly in the criminal world of Gotham City. When the other criminals learn that Harley is going to live without Joker now, they think they can beat her or use her sooner. The criminal Roman Sionis (Ewan McGregor) is looking for a hidden diamond that contains the details of a hidden loot. The young pickpocket Cassandra Colin (Ella Jay Basco) accidentally comes into possession of the diamond while robbing people, so Roman puts a price on her head. Harley tries to take the diamond from Kassandra in a friendly way, because if someone from Sionis gets hold of her people, they will more brutally take the diamond from the young girl. During the time that Harley and Cassandra spend together, the two paths cross with Sionis former collaborator Black Canary (Jurnee Smollett-Bell), the Mafia fighter Huntress (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) and the agent Renee Montoya (Rosie Perez). The four decide to protect Kassandra and to fight with Sionis and his criminal team.This film was written by Christina Hodson, who, apart from the Sci-FI film Bumblebee, only wrote the scripts of two messy thrillers. The character of Harley Quinn is known to be a bit twisted after the time she spent with the psychopathic Joker. This film is largely told from its point of view, which sometimes makes it seem chaotic in an appropriate way. Unfortunately, this entertaining chaos loses its clarity at some point, making the film seem too messy and more and more difficult to follow. The story jumps from the now with flashbacks to the past. Switches between the storylines of the different characters in a difficult to follow manner. Or the storylines are told unnecessarily in a long-winded way. With a better script or a co-writer they could have had a better end result where the story would have been a bit smoother and they had paid more attention to the details. Christina Hodson is also scheduled as a writer for two new future DC films in the DC film series, but it is better to schedule a co-writer for clearer scrips.
The film is also too feminist, because all male characters are portrayed as villains or weak idiots. The fight scenes are well portrayed, but lack real excitement, because the female characters always know how to defeat their male opponents too easily. In combat, for example, male opponents never use their weapons or arrive too late, which means that these scenes do not appear realistic.Margot Robbie came up with the idea for this film and had it made in consultation with the film studio and DC. Margot Robbie is also one of the producers of this film and now wanted to show her Harley Quinn character in her own way in this film. Birds of Prey is also the title of a DC comic series, but this film is not exactly the same as this series, because the film is actually more about the character of Harley Quinn. This way she manages to portray her role in a good and personal way, but she also has to do it with less script. The rest of the cast is given a little less time to develop their characters in the film or to present them well. You can see their background information in a hurry in flashbacks. It can be seen that Ewan McGregor had fun filming this film, because in his scenes he comes across as the villain of the story. Unfortunately, he seems a bit too exaggerated at the end and cannot be taken seriously any more at a time.






What happens when you keep shilling for the idiotic woke narrative only regressive degenerates enjoy? This move, among many others, does. Bland, boring and ridiculous in the worst of ways.






The action scenes weren't complimented by the cinematography, all the characters were very one-sided, there were many small plot holes and generally the violence was really meh. The movie tried many times to be funny and a few times managed it, although without being too cringy the rest of the times. I don't want to hate the movie but it's not that enjoyable to have a good time.






Another 'super' flop! I had low expectations from the trailers and the movie met them. Another softening of DC, story and action where both clunky. Not funny enough, not violent enough and not enough of a story line. What a waste of good actors and good DC characters.






Admittedly speaking, remember there was a time when DC Universe was bashed because most of their movies were directed by Zack Snyder who decided that style-over-substance was more pivotal to making superhero films? Then, came David Ayer with a set of the best movie trailers ever created but the outcome for the anti-hero film, Suicide Squad was at best, a mediocre motion picture.Now after Shazam!, Aquaman & the masterpiece Joker, DC presents us with Birds of Prey, the fourth entry movie that proves that their tables have pretty much turned around by finding suitable directors for their movies and that they are catching up to compete with the Marvel Universe. No feud here please.Here's my thoughts on Birds of Prey:The movie features slick action scenes which complete with very acrobatic-like choreography that constantly pleases the eyes of everyone who are looking forward for femme fatales kicking ass. There are plenty of them to keep you amazed.Birds of Prey also delivers a vigorous energy throughout, it feels like you are high on drugs. The close-ups feel very intimate yet feel very caricature in a positive way. The quality of cameras & the colour palette capture a reality of life, giving a sense of how rough it actually is, very dark and gritty but... also sometimes sprinkles the dour tone with graciously boisterous and delicate tinted colours. The occasional slo-mo ampes up the already intense energy.Some of you might have asked regarding the feminist movement. Birds of Prey is a done right feminist film. A key successful factor to driving a feminist film is to create an innate story on women without being pushy on the political agenda. Birds of Prey does that. Another thing is this is not a guy-turn-girl remakes (Yes, I'm watching you Ghostbusters & Ocean's 8). And BOP does not or rarely knocks down the men genes as weak or indecisive. Kudos Birds of Prey!Now, let's talk about Margot Robbie & Mary Elizabeth Winstead. These two really go beyond the next level to dive into their character as uniquely as possible. Margot Robbie as always should be receiving a standing ovation as Harley Quinn again, after the meh Suicide Squad. She restrains from letting anyone steals her spotlight. If her and Joaquin Phoenix's Joker are caught together in a love story, it will be the best romance movie of the decade. The complexity and different types of deranged personalities they uphold. Wow! Winstead as Huntress is the runner up here, she gives out a hot breeze of aura that it is hard to back away from. Her charismatic sexual energy captures the attention like a bullseye 🎯. Bell as Black Canary is cool, but not as great as the other two. Bella as Cain shows to be mischievous but her character only pretty much follows where the major characters take her.It also offers decent humour overall. Harley Quinn is consciously great in this, her facial movements contribute a lot! Some are fresh from the oven, others are a bit obsolete but those humours though feel old keep us glued to the screen.Final battle, the best thing is the lack of unrealistic weaponry that they occupy which makes it all feels so real. It is entertaining and fun too as there are certain scenes that feature a low amount of quick cuts.Now, the most detectable problem with this movie is it spends so much time on character development of the all-girls group that it forgets that they can excite the audience with the combo pack. An hour later and they are still focusing on so many character devs!Because of this, the relationship between members of Birds of Prey is very shadowy and leaves an unsatisfied feeling by the end. Like somehow they have been forced exponentially to know and work with one another.So many developments but they forget Roman's character, the main antagonist which feels quite underdeveloped. When a scene of him pops up especially after 40% of the film, it really wants to tell something meaningful about him, but eventually moves on with it, providing us with a lack of knowledge of what his wholesome embodies.Hyena & police cop. With a lack of screen time, we do not really see Hyena attacking people at all which some of you might have anticipated. Renee as the cop is one that is really bad at acting, it needs fixing. It is like watching a brick talks with try-hard emotions.While this centres on supervillains, Birds of Prey fails on the costume design. Not a single character clothes himself/herself as a good superhero model portrayal of a costume. It feels very lazy thus, this however tones down the great energy the movie has possessed. It is so bad that varsity students can design them better.Verdict: Imaginative & darkly flamboyant, Birds of Prey proves that the comeback of DC is possible, adapting many characters into the big screen as a beacon of call to level itself with the colossal Marvel.






The only good thing about this film is the existence and appearance of Harley Quinn herself or else the story is stupid + illogical and the other characters are also lame - Nothing great.






A film that centers around Harley Quinn's break up with the joker but handles it in a way that comes off as it is bashing Suicide Squad. With a villain played by Ewan McGregor that could have gone down well but just like the joker in suicide squad didn't have enough screen time for you to care and just one or two moments in the film that tried to make him look like a big mafia boss but fell flat. The women empowerment in the film just seems like it's forced in to the film instead of coming off natural. Came out of the cinema feeling like there was nothing worth caring about, no real big talking points, couldn't seem to decide between cartoon violence or deadpool violence






2 hours of terrible fighting scenes and some of the worst comedy in a movie from the past 20 years. They never should've released it...






Why does Hollywood feel they are responsible for teaching, preaching would actually work better, us how we should think, act, and behave.This is basically Charlie's Angles with hotter actresses and better acting. But it's the same plot, men evil, women good.For me, it's getting boorish.Margo Robbie is awesome, I think she will have a special career worthy of remembrance some day, but it won't be for this. This will be a 'Oh My God, I know' moment when she is doing a retrospective interview 30 years from now.






Feminazi vibes with crazy laughs here and there
Jumping and screaming here and there!
Is it actually a movie or just a not funny long skit?! Hard to tell






Why did you guys did her so dirty? One of the badass Woman characters in the DC universe and you idiots do this 🙄
Our team decided to give it a shot and went to watch birds of prey. We left after 19 minutes, the room was quite empty anyway. We went to the other room and watched again bad boys for life. I'm not sure why Hollywood feminists are still trying to shove this woke stuff into our brains. People ain't that dumb. At least most of us aren't.






I'm only going to say this, birds of a feather, flock off. I'll stick with suicide squad, where Harley at least had the role that was perfect for her character ( Joker's 2 minutes of footage aside ). It was boring, some parts ok i guess, but overall a yawn-fest. Good visuals, not bad in parts ( no spoilers ) but oh my lord did i yawn for the most of it. I actually yearned for Wonderwoman, or even that blithering ugh-fest of a character Batwoman ( the one with monotone and a terrible wardrobe ). It's WB for crying out loud, they have the capital to hit this out of the park, but this got buried instead, we love you ladies, but oh my this could have gone way better. I really do hope the next one gets it right, but these insert group vs insert group movies? they really never go down with couple therapy movie sessions.






I think DC were hoping for a female Dead Pool, but from casting onwards this film is just a mess. Ewan McGregor is just so bad he should hand back the pay cheque. The rest aren't much better.






This movie was just so boring. There is literally nothing fun about it. It is exactly like suicide squad. The only thing I liked in this entire movie was the ricochet bat throw knock out thing by Harley during a fight scene. The best 3 seconds of the film.






I value female super hero movies equally as a male versions. But, this time it was sad to see the sexism in this movie and the over-promotion of feminism. Of course, you can make as many feminist movies as you want BUT not at the cost of degrading the male gender - that's what birds of prey has done showing awesome combat skills of Quinn's small girl gang against a gang of 100 guys which they have portrayed as guys who are brainless and can't fight for s#!t.
Wow how un logical lol with plot itself being vague.
F¥ck feminismWould prefer Wonder women - a film that shows no necessity of feminism, just woman who is protecting the people and fighting the bad.Anyways 2 stars
1 for Harley Quinn the main
1 for good screenplay and cinematography






As I sit here in this cinema, pondering a the meaning of life, I've been given the opportunity to do this by coming to see a god awful fantasy film with no rhyme or reason to its shabbily concocted storyline and semi large budget, it just makes no sense and is nonsense. Please save yourself
The hassle i bet you. The humour in this film is so weird. It might make an eleven year old laugh but the problem is it's too violent for that age group.In summary if you like mindless violence and crass jokes then in a fantasy setting, go watch this. For most normal people, save yourself some money and time this is dire. Don't even wait for it on DVD.






Margot Robbie's acting has never been more one note and gimmicky then in this movie. The plot is boring, the first act is ridiculously uneventful and repetitive. The rest of the movie is just WB desperate attempt at reproducing Deadpool's funny antics. The other girls could not have been there and we would have gotten the same story.






Worst movie of all times. Ruined all the characters and deserve zero out of ten






You mean to tell me DC, yet again, failed to deliver?? Big shocker! Obviously whoever's signing off on making this movies needs a new job. Aquaman was decent, I'll give them that, but that's been the only one worth seeing since the beginning of this whole freak show. Either figure it out or just stop, DC. Stay on paper!






Birds of Prey is a movie that shouldn't have gotten made, period. Harley Quinn isn't supposed to be an R rated, Deadpool, and yet, here we are. F bombs ranging in the hundreds and yet, hardly a cleaver line to be found.
When is Warner Brothers going to learn, if it's not like the original creators character, it's not going to work. Paul Dinni and Bruce Timm created an amazing character. You had a wonderful talent in Margot Robbie, playing said character, and yet the writers and director instead turned Harley into a degenerative character of truly sad, trash. Drinking and swearing her way through a confusing and grotesque world, and worse meandering script, that did little to raise the character into the realm of interesting.
Funny how a 25 year old cartoon could have more character development in 22 minutes than a 100 million dollar movie can in 2 hours. Sad.






This film start with Harley Quinn narrate about she broke up with Joker, and everyone want her dead, including a crime lord "Roman" scene! As turnout, this film is about Harley Quinn need to protect a girl "Cassandra" from Roman, because Cassandra accidentally stole Roman's ring and swallow it! Entire film full of annoying narration voice and flashback scene of Harley Quinn! Make the film unwatchable! Barely laughable scene is, The Huntress want to say her name, but the people keep mocking her name! The action in the film also quite messy, not intense and full of overuse slow motion scene! The action have shooting scene, martial art fighting scene, hitting with baseball bat scene, and stabbing scene! All the action scene barely watchable, because it not enough bloody violence scene! Such as, Harley Quinn shooting at the police station scene! She shooting confetti instead of real bullet! LMFAO! At the end, Harley Quinn and Cassandra kill Roman by a grenade! Harley Quinn's sidekicks setup a gang called "Birds Of Prey"! Still have one post credit narration scene from Harley Quinn! She mocking the audience still stay put and talking a secret about Batman! That's it! Another disappointed blockbuster film!
Birds of Prey and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn......The far left liberal women had a field day with that one 😂Coming 2021: (Brought to you by men)
Man of Steel Conquers the Feminazi Oppressors 👍






If you want to be hyper-kinetically assaulted visually this is a great movie. However if you were expecting some semblance of a movie forget it. From the beginning you will be assaulted by hyper-kinetic action scenes, and hyper-kinetic narration by Harley Quinn. That narration is really unnecessary, all you had to do was tell the story in order, not keep going back and telling the backstory every 15 minutes, that narration just destroyed the flow of the movie. There are a couple of scenes where the movie tries to be caring and sensitive, those scenes are completely out of place in this movie. None of the humour was funny. The villain was not even scary, he was just an idiot. I knew this movie wasn't going to be great, but I didn't expect it to be this stupid. When are we going to get a comic book movie for adults and not for 12 year olds? I think WB has killed the DCEU with this movie.
This movie failed on every level for me. The action scenes were somewhat decent, but the editing is on par with Suicide Squad at times. The story is told out of order, which would work if it had an interesting one. The portrayal of the characters was somewhat adequate, but the focus on Harley just showed how insecure this chick is about her career.
I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone with reasonable standards.






Going to keep this short and simple. I walked out of the movie 30 mins in. The movie was horrible.






I didn't like this movie and I didn't hate it. I felt it was serviceable but that it could have been better with a more competent director and writer. They wanted a female to direct and write, but were these people really the best for the job? It doesn't help when your lead actress acts like she would rather be somewhere else. They have got to recast Margot Robbie. She is beyond awful as an actress. She's either not motivated or the director isn't pushing her enough.What happened to the people who did those amazing Suicide Squad movies? What happened to the person who made the trailer for the first Suicide Squad movie? They did a better job capturing Harley Quinn than two horrible directors ever could. It's pretty bad when some animated film that went straight-to-DVD beats the pants off the big-budget live-action movies I just got eighties and nineties vibes from this movie of an era prior to Marvel where Hollywood just bought the rights to a comic book superhero or videogame character just to make a quick buck. I haven't seen fight scenes this terrible since the nineties. I used to do Tae Kwon Do and it kind of hurt to see female characters using moves that would get them destroyed because of their light weight. Nothing was ever established too that these characters are enhanced in any way.For starters, Harley Quinn is and always will be a supporting character. She's not a "strong, independent woman." Harley even states this in the movie, defining what a harlequin is. You can't make her a leading lady. It doesn't help when the actress playing her is clearly not committed to pushing the envelope with the role. I also do not like the outfit, it's another callback to the terrible low-effort nineties adaptations.Mary Elizabeth-Winstead is just horrible. The Huntress character is just awful to begin with. What trained, efficient killer uses a crossbow? Seriously. Nothing was even done to give the impression this crossbow was special or that Huntress should be feared. She's even more apathetic in the role than Margot, giving the bare minimum of effort in terms of acting. I can see why her career never took off. There's a lot of potential there with her, but she doesn't want to be an actress. Why still take the jobs then?Jussie Smollett's sister, Rosie Perez, Ewan MacGregor and the actor who played Victor are pretty much the only actors who made any effort in this entire movie. This could have been a lot better, it's just a shame. There are some other elements I noticed that bugged me, but it's not PC so I don't want to be censored. It has to do with things the director pushed in because of her heritage, including many unlikable actors that rubbed me the wrong way and elements that would get any other director or writer called a racist.I would wait for DVD. I got my ticket free but want my time back, sorry. Might be time to reboot and recast, that's all.






I think my laughter point is very low but when I'm watching this movie i can't laugh! So embarrassing!
What's going on the last part? Is the scream a superpower? I can't understand why she can do that without persuasion. DC made a poor movie even though Harley Quinn is cute.






Hollywood seem to think twitter and CNN are real life...um no. Absolute rubbish.






I watched it and I'll never get that time back, dont make the same mistake I did. Its straight feminist trash






Erm yeah, my brain bled from this film. What the heck was Ewan McGregor thinking??? I can't even be bothered to explain how bad this film was...






They ruined most of their key character. the only good character is harley and black mask. this movie shouldve been called harley meets deadpool 2 medicore movie b/c they messed up the bop characters. plus they ruined cassandra cain character to be 2 bit thief. they ruin cassandra in this girl since i know she becomes an assassin at a young age then later taken in by batman as his 2nd batgirl. they had no oracle biggest character from the franchise comic books to be missing. the only good thing are fight scenes. plot of this movie is a joke. i hope this movie flops hard. i rather go see that bad xmen movie again






Birds of Prey is split into two halves that really just don't fit well together as a full movie. The first hour or so is setting up all of the characters. Harley gets the most of this time, but Black Canary , Renee Montoya and Cassie Cain each get shortened establishment. The 2nd half is where the movie finally starts it's plot, but one that just isnt that interesting.The comedy is definitely going for a Deadpool-esque vibe. Although it never gets as raunchy as DP does. It's rarely as funny as it thinks it is.The Huntress was probably the only funny aspect because of her self seriousness in contrast to the other wacky characters. She's a dark serious type hero, a Batman caricature of sorts. The bit about being initially called "The Crossbow Killer" is decently funny. It's sad that she's only really a major character in the last 1/4th of this movie.The plot is really just a device to introduce the characters and tell Harley's story. It boils down to bad guy, Black Mask, is after a diamond with microscopic bank information etched in it, Harley and other mercenaries are sent to get it. This story doesn't actually kick in until the hour mark as Harley freeze frames and rewinds back to establishing Det. Montoya, Black Canary, and Cassandra Cain for the first hour literally just before the plot gets into gear. It just halts everything as now they want to make sure we really understand the non-Harley characters.The action was lacking and uninspired as well. It relied way too much on slow-mo fights or just too much going on to really understand it all. You know you have a poorly made fight sequence when they decide to use slow motion on every punch or hit to make it seem cooler than it is.I hate to compare it to Marvel and I'd like it to stand on it's own merits, but it comes off as a failed attempt at a Guardians crossed with Deadpool (which Suicide Squad was also a failed attempt at). It for sure could have taken a few notes from Guardians and how superbly well that movie set up the characters and got the plot into gear within the first 45 mins of that one.Margot Robbie is still great despite the material, and I really enjoyed Mary Elizabeth Winatead's caricature of a super serious dark hero, but besides those this movie just isn't that interesting. It's just a mediocre imitation of two superhero formulas done much better before it.






This was a waste of time and money and had to leave after an hour. It is another woke Hollywood movie that bashes men. All the men in the movie are portrayed as stupid, oppressors and/or violent. It pushes the false narrative that behind every successful man is a smarter woman that the man is oppressing to get ahead. I was also surprised that Harley Quinn is such a bimbo character for being the face of girl power. If you are a man don't let your significant other drag you to see this hot mess of wokeness.






The only good thing about this movie is Black mask's aka Ewan's performance and the other things are just messy and it's wanna be cool girls of Gotham movie...I hate how they rushed the movie...Oh my God!!! The movie story line is terrible and makes no sense..Only cast performances are good.. that's all..Don't spend money instead save it for better movies..






OK let me start out with this: I love female characters - I am a man yes - but I really don't care what gender the character is, as long as it has been well written and performed. I could give tons of examples of movies where the female characters outshine (in my mind) the male characters - but let's just take Guardians of the Galaxy where Nebula and Gamora are my favorite characters... Ok...You know this is bad when I have to make a disclaimer first right? :-)I really wanted to love this movie... but... "insert random profanities here"Ok the first and most important thing to point out is this: This movie seems to be very poorly managed. In fact, the action scenes looks like they aren't all part of the same movie - so I had to look it up. Some of the original action scenes were apparently SO BAD that they called in the guy who did the action scenes in John Wick to RESHOOT them ... and it shows! Those scenes + Margot is the only reason why I even give this movie 3 stars...The Birds ... holy s... I mean really? They are just so weak it's insane... and no I'm not talking physical strength or fighting prowess - but story telling - or lack there of. Poorly set up, "out of the blue" abilities, lazy lines... It's not even worth going on about it, since I already spend more time on this paragraph than the writers did on this script!The Black Mask/Roman Sionis - Ewan does what he can with this character, however it is the most generic villain of them all (in the comics) It is just ... WHY THAT CHARACTER? I mean SERIOUSLY DC - you are TRYING to build up the franchise - and on top trying to make this about female empowerment - then why the H... did you pair it with a throwaway antagonist? It makes 0 to little sense - unless you actually didn't care about this movie... which... is... what... it... feels... like. For crying out loud DC...... And lastly it commits the cardinal sin... it's just not funny. I mean I laugh very easily - and I think I smiled like 2 times through the whole movie and laughed 0. It's a movie with Harley Quinn... how am I not laughing - she is probably the funniest character in the DC catalog - or at least in the top 3...... so how did they manage to make me laugh 0 times?I literally can't grasp how people are giving this movie 9 and 10's ... Suicide Squad was better - and that says a lot since I hated it! Is it only because of the fact that it has a theme of "female empowerment" ... or is it a "R rated superhero movies are AWESOME ALWAYS" thing? I honestly can't think of anything else....Love you Margot - but you should never have signed up for this pile of incompetence!






Too much fantasy fighting with no logic applied. It's just women swinging and men flying in the air. Yes, put your hand up and wave them in the air like just don't care!!This not you typical back in the days action movie. Movies nowadays are targeted towards the soy generation who fantasize about being what men were in post WW2.Ho yes, it will get worse! The quality of America filmmaking is suffering with the open opportunity for other countries to bring there Game on like Korean film TRAIN TO BUSAN! A must watch!!!

Birds of Prey is another great addition to the DCEU and whilst it certainly has its flaws, I absolutely had a blast with the filmMargot Robbit is perfect and she kills it. As for the supporting characters, they range genuinely are all good especially Mary Elizabeth Winstead who is awesome.
As great as Ewan McGregor Is, he feels generic and kinda of a stupid villain although his over the topness does work well. The bad guys are great even if they aren't revolutionary.
The story feels fresh and unique in style but if you look at the skeleton of a story, it really isn't anything special. I do love the cinematography and colours, it looks awesome.
There are some really terrific scenes here. The action is great and done extremely well (thanks to having Chad Stahleski help), it looks great, shot great and well choreographed mostly. The slow motion doesn't work. Some of it feels brutal and I I that. My favourite action scenes were probably the one in the evidence room and the alley fight. But I do like the funhouse fight cause it's kinda original.The reason why I like the DCEU is because all their films have different tones unlike the MCU which feel very samey despite being in different having different genres.
As far as Marvel Humour Syndrome goes, it does suffer not massively though. It just is a tad cringe at times (only a few), the light heartedness does work a lot of the time, but sometimes it could have done without
Overall as great as the film is, It could really use some more depth in the story, other than it is decent. But that being said it still is a win for the DCEU.
If you're any older than that, the plot holes and the thinly disguised "feminist" messages overwhelm the story. I heard a lot about the difficulties they had filming this and the director melting down and it shows in the finished product. I don't even know where to start about the terrible costume design and the poor lighting that often makes the stunning in-real-life Ms. Robbie look like she's aging poorly.Suicide Squad had its issues but overall it was a fun and enjoyable movie with characters I rooted for. This film manages to tear down what was really great about the reimagining of the Joker and Harley in that movie, and turn Harley into yet another bitter, single woman with anger issues. I can see that at the supermarket and it won't cost me $8.






Another "quick let's grab a female cast and try and compete with men" type of movie with boring story and bad actors, Harley is the draw card, but the movie steers away from her and focuses on the other nufftys, it's quite clear they wanted this to become a series or trilogy, it will be lucky to get a sequel I'd say.






Harley blows up Ace Chemicals and then gets abused the rest of the movie, failing to live up to the image of Harley in Suicide Squad.Cinema Sins will have their hands full sinning the nonstop narration.Had hoped for better, but standard DC meh...come on DC you can do better.I may have to stick to solo Batman movies at this rate.






When is Hollywood and the rest of the entertainment business gonna learn that these all women movies are never ever gonna work? This movie was absolute trash. Wouldn't recommend it to my own worst enemy






Of course, most movies have a message. "Saving Private Ryan", war is difficult, calls for sacrifice, often involves great valor.James Bond: evil communist.Evil terrorists.In many recent movies I've enjoyed the message is racism. The "bad guy" intolerant people.Your average comic book based movie: good guys battle bad guys, often criminal geniuses, evil corporate bosses, corrupt politicians... and win.Semi-spoiler. The bad guy in this movie is - all men. There is not a good one in the bunch. Put down, oppressed, mistreated women band together and do in the guys who are all bad.As an entertainment vehicle, the star does a good job. The cast does a good job. The movie has the the standard tropes of most action movies, especially comic book related one in good order: fights, chases, shoot outs, explosions. Fun enough us versus them shoot'em up.But, the blatant message "men are bad guys and women should get together and basically destroy them"... horrible. Even for a simplistic comic book movie. Are women often mistreated and abused by men? Yes. Do women deserve a comic book villain to even the score as some man bad guy heroes have done? I have no problem with that. Just like with there finally being movies with a black super hero at the core. But, just imagine if you will those movies making all whites "evil" and all whites deserving of the usual comic book bashing, maiming, blowing up, dispatching with no attempt at depicting any whites as being worthy of not being dealt such "justice" by the "hero"?The women in charge of creating this movie should be ashamed. Just because comic book movies can paint things in all white and all good v. all black and all evil doesn't mean they should in an area of real social concern. Sadly, too many people buy the message without any thought or dilution.And, what is even sadder is those women who were at the top of creating this "women v. all men who are evil" message, engage in tactics that do damage to women in the process. The female star wears sexual attention getting hot pants throughout. The woman star shoots up a police station full of, of course, all evil men, with what looks like a confetti/paint gun.Yes, the "good guy" hero woman is shown to be less than 100% virtuous, shown to have, even, brought on some of abuse/mistreatment she suffers.But the message all men are evil abusers of women and female justice givers can and should pummel and end all men is wrong. And a dangerous grenade to lob in to what is a serious social area we should all address more and with real thought and concern even in comic book world.
Harley Quinn & Joker are so popular, how did you f-up this movie??? Come on!!!!






The movie has some moments of entertainment specially since John Wick stunt director is behind of the project but it fails to connect in the character level and story plus changing the Race of some Characters without a logical reason a throwing another Feminism good Vs Patriarchy bad concept wich I'm honestly sick. Also why is there are no more female characters using Sexy outfits? This new era is getting incredible stupid .






Multi million dollar movie is worse then a cartoon... Why do such thing at all? Don't spend any money on this or you will feel like you have been robbed.
Boaring movie for little girls only.






Basically this is a movie were the characters go from place to place without a motivation, because the plot is a pathetic excuse to push an agenda (not that weird these days). Of course every man is super evil and of course every woman is perfect, no flaws, a perfect mary sue that doesn't need nothing and nobody. None of the main characters faces any challenge or any type of struggle whatsoever, no character growth or interesting plot line, the movie is just brainless and stagnant.
The fight scenes are incredibly pathetic, some of the worst I've ever seen.
I would give it a 3/10 because it's a bad movie, but because of the feminist agenda and because of the fact that they BUTCHERED the original characters and the universe from which they came from, this "movie" deserves a 1/10
I'd rather watch "the last jedi" rather than watch this movie again






This movie would probably be a hit with young girls - but it's rated R, so very few will see it. And it's intolerable for most adults.






Woke Feminist Propaganda.Doesn't Move the DCEU Forward.This Was Purely Trying to Emulate the 2016 "Harley Quinn Mania"Why Did DC Start Building a Connected Universe, Only to Press the Self Destruct Button?First Joker, Now this, Suicide Squad & The Batman Next?






You can always tell when someone reviews a movie that has either not even seen the film, or only wants to compare the film to an old comic book ... instead of just enjoying the film on its own merit and without any agenda. BoP was fun to watch, well worth the price of admission, and highly recommended.






Wanted to get excited for Harley getting her own movie before my favorite Black Widow, lol. Not sure how DC pulled it off but they should have waited.Script was all over the place; the action was forced/average and the Birds of Prey were not needed. Really feel Suicide Squad gave Harley more energy than this one did.Hopefully no sequel to this or any Birds of Prey variation.






What can you expect from a movie that was made from twitter shills with blue checkmarks for twitter shills with blue checkmarks and 16 year old girls who never saw or touched a comicbook movie before in their life who soon will bombard this movie with 10/10 reviews, it is literally a movie filled with pure ignorance towards men like they want to prove that men are somekind of evil beings well soon the movie releases and you can find out yourselves and see this movies box office stats underperform cause the white straight male they said this movie is not made for will boycott and go watch somethibg worth your time and money. The only sole reason this movie exists just like Terminator dark flop,Charlie's flop, Oceans Flop, Ghostfloppers 2016.captain Flop etc ate the 0.00001% of the SJW who want to spread their liberal agendas and force them down your throat.
P.s might aswell stare into a screen of pure blackness then watch this trash again.






This movie was so teen, dude.
Warner and dc must restart their universe.






This movie is worse than Ghostbusters. I am gonna demand refund for money I spend on this. Shame






Everything looks cool. From the action sequences, to the settings, plot, and chemistry between the casts and most importantly Ewan McGregor as Roman Sionis and Mary Elizabeth Winstead as The Huntress . Kudos to the whole team. Margot Robbie deserves special appreciation for pitching this idea and managed to convince The WB studios to produce the film.Ahh!! It looks like Dudebros are coming in packs to give a single star rating. I bet most of them didn't even see the movie yet.






Dont waste your money. Buy cheeseburger instead!!!






Why? WB why?? Do a flashpoint paradox movie but not this male hating garbage






Why make such a great movie for the Joker and such a LAME movie for Harley Quinn ?!
We really need more serious badass women in the movies !
Don't watch this, it's useless except maybe for the music or Harley Quinn's outfits...






I had low expectations for this movie to begin with. All this movie was is girl power, all men are evil mysogynistic scum that hate all women. I'm so over all this political agenda






The movie is a solid 8, yes some says it's feminist BS or whatever, but fun is fun! The fight was awesome, the jokes were funny, the storyline was okay.After Wonder Woman, Shazam, Aquaman, Joker and now this, I think DC's starting to put up a fight against their mortal enemy.If you're a casual movie goers like me who just go watch movies to have a good time, you're gonna enjoy it.






WB trying their best to pivot the DC UNIVERSE to look at the chick friendly characters they have since they axed the BATMAN/SUPERMAN solos. yeah as a fan i'm kinda sad but hartley quinn ain't doin that for me and for that reason i'm ouuuuuut!






Pass on this one or wait for dvd. Story rambled for 1sr half of the movie and almost put me to sleep.






Just watcthed tonight. Margot Robbie has a bad ass acting👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽, but story line is not impressive, just like "B" movie, very shallow.. sorry






I liked this movie for about the first 20 minutes or so, but after that it just loses all momentum. The movie is essentially a fusion of "The Guardians of the Galaxy" and "Deadpool". But it is much less enjoyable than either of those movies. It's just action, forgettable character scene, more action, etc.
The parts of the movie I like were Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn, doing a fun take of the character, no longer in an abusive relationship with the Joker, and Ewan McGregor as Roman Sionis. My biggest disappointed is Zsas, because I am a fan of the Arkham video game series and he just felt wasted here.
I would say skip this movie its just forgettable and not really worth your time or money. If I had to say watch "Parasite", "Uncut Gems", or "1917" if you want to see a movie in theaters, because none of these will disappoint. Or just stay home and watch a movie that's really good.






When your a true fan, there are standards you expect. No 1 is that if your going to take one of my fav books and turn it into a tv/movie, you would know your subject matter and try and make the best you can. Maybe get a writer from the books to help, instead of a actor who has no care! No.2 REFER TO No.1. It's that simple. I was so looking forward to seeing the best all girl team, Lead By the greatest hero, in my eyes, Barbra Gordon, Either as Batgirl or Oracle. As she is the one who starts the Birds of Prey, you would think she's there. But No! who cares about the Fans, There is a reason why the books sell and are respected, isn't that why you chose to do it in the first place!! As a true Fan I ask all fans to speak up at let D.C know we are sick of this trash!!!!
Well, DC does it again. Poor plot, one good fight scene. Perez's acting is bad or maybe bad writing or just bad casting. But that some up the whole movie.It's sad that when after seeing this movie me and my friends started talking about Avengers: End game quotes to makes us feel better.






All the men in this film are caricatures of bad men in the real world. Margot Robbies character thinks she can count on one man never ever betraying her, but he does proving that no man in the world is trustworthy and they're all out to hurt women. The entire movie is based on her breakout with the joker and how she was the brains behind his success.
I'm not going to see this film, at least not until it's on Netflix or something equivalent.I like Margot Robbie, but as with some other recent productions, the marketing of this movie turned me off, and it appears many others as well. With the stars of the film proclaiming it to be a feminist "girl power" production, while bemoaning the "toxic male gaze." Then there's Ewan McGregor, constantly proclaiming, while promoting the movie, how all the men in the film are misogynists.I don't want to be preached at. I just want to enjoy a movie. The Birds of Prey type of promotion eliminates much of the potential audience before the picture even premieres.I like strong female leads and have enjoyed many films over the years where women were in charge. Lately, Hollywood feels the need to empower women by demeaning men. You don't need to do that. If you make a female empowering film without the obvious gender politics, men will come to see it. Alien, one of my all time favorites, and Wonder Woman, being two cases in point.I believe the movie's marketing is largely responsible for shooting its own box office in the foot.






I mean, yes, Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn is good and you can't imagine anybody else doing the part but the reality is that the screenplay is painfully awful. What was Christina Hodson thinking? For the first time in my life I almost walked out middle screening. It's that bad. Again, it's not Robbie's fault, she did what she could with the given material. What a waste of potential.






Kinda feel these all female films are not appealing.
It's just too much effort and little substance equates to a contrived boring film .
Slow at first gets fast but fizzles quickly
Sure Margot Robbie is beautiful a good actress but it's the whole let's make a wile film for woke films sake .
Should have made a film based on art , great script would help ... should be immersed in the genre as opposed to immersing the genre into pc.






I don't get the negative reviews at all ! great movie with really beautiful john wick type action sequences but not as over the top as john wick. i'm a guy and i LOVED this film. my only complaint is that there isn't a lot of black mask in the film but it's not a dealbreaker. Lately, we've gotten the "agenda" pushed heavily onto us, in some cases (captain marvel) it's been forced and BOP is obviously in the same lane but it is done so tastefully and masterfully. margot robbie is a phenomenal actress, she absolutely nails the part and so do all the other beautiful women in this film. do yourself a favor and watch it, it's got great humor that isn't forced and really top notch action sequences.






Much like other people who have reviews for this movie I'm going to talk about the Fempower aspects in this movie first so it can just be done and over with. Yes, this movie goes "woke". Yes it is annoying. Not a single male character is shown to be "good". From the borderline laughable portrait of Misogyne that is Black Mask, to the credit stealing police captain, and even a spoiler but still you'll know it when you see it. It almost makes it hard to enjoy anything when theirs not a single character that's a person unless they happen to be female, and even then all they really feel like is shells for female impowerment. Now, that's out of the way. The voice over is used WAY TO MUCH and the flashbacks are used in order to be "different" but shows how little of a story they have. Is their good?
Yes, actually their a few good things. The editing isn't the worst DC films have had and the action fits the over the top nature of the movie which makes it fun to watch. The set desing lends itself well to having what amounts to a cool acid trip which I enjoy. The acting is....ok. All the actors are fine and you can tell they are having fun. which makes you feel like you're having fun.
Is this movie good? Not even close but their is a sense of enjoyment to be had. Maybe, if u got drunk or high you could enjoy the amount of colors that go on the screen. If u want a movie that actually gives these characters any amount of depth that they should get (both men and women) go watch Assault on Arkham.






What do you look for in a female hero? Confidence, purpose, maybe a bit of dignity. Well... Youve come to the wrong place. What you can come to expect is a shallow superficial film with female leads that have no direction, are easily distracted (by glitery bags, hair ties and a sandwich) and ultimately thier roles within the storyline rely entirely on powerful men. Such a shame as the film provided some punchy, colourful scenes, a kickass soundtrack and glimpses of well choreographed fight scenes.






Well the movie was a bit entertaining, but the feminism overdose in it was unbearable. Plus the story was rubbish . Don't waste your money .






It's like Harley Movie and Birds of Prey in the background.
The screenwriting is bad, so bad, too many things that i have to shut my brain to enjoy watching it, one moment the bad guys have gun but then disappears because the Girls just could fight melee. what the. and sometimes the bad guys just magically disappears. WOW. and that final fight... WOW.. disappointing..
The Birds of Prey characters are so boring and disappointing, bad writing, costumes are bad, AND WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO Cassandra Cain!! Oh God she is like the best Batgirl and you made her like that, so annoying and unlikable. NOPE.
I Just hope this movie just focused on Bird Of Prey. Huntress story is interesting.(+)
Some of the fights are so badass. Thanks to John Wick choreographer.






I generally like most movies I see.
That's why I was sad I didn't like this one. I liked Suicide Squad. Lol im not hard to please. LolGood:
Harley Quinn. Robbie is an awesome Harley. I don't know if her outfits were right but who cares right? Except comic fans which I'm not. Her voice, look, and etc is Harley.Fight scenes: they were good. Unrealistic with the whole women easily beating up men. But it's a comic movie I don't need realism watching Harley bop people in the head was fun.Black Canary: she was a great actress. Got Pam Grier vibes. Beautiful and dressed to the nines. 1 complaint how'd she get her powers and when did Gotham get metas? 100 Batman' movies and have never seen a meta. Yea Dr Strange has created some superpower villains. But how did she get her powers? Shouldn't she be in Star City with the Arrow?The Bad:
Rosie character. The detective with no name.The villain. He wasn't a villain at all he bought a diamond, Cassandra stole it and he wanted it back. Even said don't kill her. Not enough character development for him.The storyline: Harley breaks up with the Joker and everyone wants to kill her until the teen Cassandra steals the diamond and now Harley offers to get it back for Black Mask so he doesn't kill her. She swallowed it so they are giving her laxatives waiting for her to poop...Really the 1st HQ movie and that's the best plot you can come up with. Super lame.Huntress: she was more of a guy and had the personality of wallpaper.Birds of Prey: give us a Harley movie. No one cares about the BOP except comic nerds. You're not getting a billion from that predominantly male demographic by making an anti man chic movie.I'm a 39 yr old female. Went with my 17 yr old daughter and 60yr old dad. None of us liked it. So who's the target demographic? Epic fail.Movie is a B-/C+
Dont know why im surprised, but DC have done it again and made an absolute pile of garbage for us all to enjoy.






When your making a movie for the sake of wokeness, diversity and shock values but forgets the big picture of what DC Universe truly means for DC fans.






I have watched it and I do have to say that Robbie makes a great Harley Quinn.
This movie sucks you in and for the next 2 hours you are trapped in the top notch, mesmerizing and hilarious story of Harley Quinn.Highly Recommended






As the title says, I was really disappointed by the lack of creativity and surprises in this movie. I thought the costumes and character design looked really good, especially Harley, but that's the only thing I really liked about this movie. Overall, very disappointed :(






So sick of the crap coming out of hollywood ... enough with the superhero movies ! How many times can you tell the story of Batman ? Yet we have 3 more movies coming out about him ...... I blame the audience for being sheep they just consume eat and don't ask questions and repeat , and this is why we have 9 fast and the furious movies .... the world is a sad place for entertainment






I wanted to like this movie, I thought I would but well no. after finding suicide squad hilarious particularly Margots acting and character and thought this would be a winner. With barely any laughs the entire film and no real solid plot it felt like you was waiting for something to happen.... which never came. The entire film felt messy and the characters were under developed and the script was horrendous. Waaaay to many cliche fight scenes, literally rolled my eyes. Amazing sound track and watching Margot Robbie was a plus. Other than that, disappointing.






So the plot is very lazy and preditcble, but that's something we can forget if we just want to see a 2 hour action film, it should at least be entertaining, but this film is just boring, since it's started de second half all i wish it ended soon. Don't bother about this people that only because a film shows women empowering it's instatly bad, it has nothing to do with that. This film is just bad because is just lazy teen entertainment.






Just watch a great marvel movie instead! Lack of action.






Good story,Good action scenes,Good acting, Margot Robbie nailed it in Harley Quinn role, it's dark as well as vibrant and worthy to watch if you a superhero movies fan or a common movie fan, Bop is better plot than Suicide squad and Justice league






Definitely the worst comic book movie I have seen, and I've seen them all.
No stand out moments to make you want to watch it again, every male character is a villain every female character is a woke hero....
Even the action sequences are no better than what you see on the CW show Arrow.
If you want to watch then just wait and download it then you can fast forward the many many boring bits.






Birds of prey shows that DC has finally righted the ship after several early stumbles in this franchise. By focusing on smaller, more personal stories with more personal stakes. Birds of prey is a very entertaining movie, albeit one with some irritating flaws.Firstly, Cathy Yan directed the hell out of this movie. She really knows how to frame an exciting action scene with nice wide, full body shots to show off the great stunt work. The movies style and colour pallet are very eye catching and visually interesting. Margot Robbie continues to be excellent as this franchises version of Harley Quinn, and Ewen McGregor looks like he's having the time of his life as a sleazy but intimidating villain.Most of the movies problems for me come from the script. The first half is very messy as the movie bounces around and moves back and forth in a Rashomon attempt that really didn't work and kind of annoyed me. Once an action scene in a police evidence locker takes place though, the movie calmed down considerably and is a lot more watchable. Also, while the other members of the cast and the villain are entertaining to watch, they only have only surface level characterisation, seemingly interesting on the surface, but not really much underneath. Some ardent birds of prey fans may be disappointed in the lack of actual birds of prey, given about 85% of this is a Harley Quinn movie, which leads me to wonder if they side the birds of prey name for brand recognition only.In conclusion, birds of prey is a fun, colourful time at the movies, But some serious screenplay flaws prevent it soaring to the heights of the DCEU, but it comfortably pitches high above the trainwreck that was suicide squad.






Just came back and it's just bad.
dc needs to stop..






This movie was not much fun. Of course it had many flaws but it so was cringey. The fight sequences were meh, and the acting was all boring. Trolls most likely loved it cause it's a very bland movie.
All those criticism hating 10 star trolls have for sure not seen the movie!






It's a feminist movie with men as the bad guy. Wait for free torrent, if you want to waste your time, as a good pirate does






Really?Man, what a waste of time. Why even bother making This kind of movies now a days.Stop wasting our times.
This was so bad. Like batsuit with nipples level of bad. Batman forever had a better plot. 1 star because I'm now an epileptic after watching this.






This movie is AWESOME. It's fun, it's fresh, it's everything we wanted but never got from suicide squad. All hail Margot Robbie!






I've seen this movie just because my gf wanted to.
If you like good movies to go and watch this.






DC ruined it again, I felt happy when I saw Shezam, it was good movie with lovable characters and I said to myself ok that's the start for the new DC universeNow with this mess DC shot themself in the footAwful, laughable mess of a movie scene with awful script, wannabe DeadpoolThe story has too many holes, no redeeming quality in it, Robbie tried but not enough, very week cast, boring action scenesLet's wait for Suicide Squad 2, let's hope James Gunn could fix this mess






It's a Harley Quinn movie, and it has nothing to do with "prey of bird".
The characters are completely different from the comics.Except for Harley Quinn, of course.
The other characters are just original characters, especially cassandra.And put comic book characters'names on their heads.






Cliches, poor acting, badly choreographed sequences, stupid script.






Another film made primarily to push the Feminist Propaganda further. Seriously when will Hollywood learn?The films plot was boring & not even interesting. The characters were annoying, obnoxious & completely unlikable.As per with these woke types of films this film portrays men as either dumb, stupid, cowardly & of course evil while all the female characters are portrayed as strong & powerful. Their actions towards the men are justified like taking advantage of them. The film is just filled with propaganda, me too & misandry in all its ugly form. Bad.I even knew from previews & news stories that this was going to be "one of those films". Margot Robbie & every other deluded woman will whinge & whine about there being a lack of female directors & wanting to end sexism in Hollywood. So making a film in which you demonize men & reversing sexism is their idea of stopping sexism? Pfft. What ever happened to making a film with actresses or female directors who were cast/selected because of their acting abilities as a pose to casting/selecting them based on their gender just for the sake of being stylish/exclusive? . It's hilarious really, not to mention pretty sad & pathetic. I even noticed in the first 10 seconds of the trailer with Harley Quinn dumping Joker was clearly a way of saying "I'm a strong independent woman I don't need a man in my life". Wow.Wish these feminists would shut up & stop thinking that cos they've got a voice that that means they're important while preaching with a narrow mind about how they're oppressed when they're not while simultaneously oppressing men with their toxic views on what equality is. These films are getting boring & it's no wonder they're flopping, go woke, go broke. Woke is a joke. Seriously Hollywood, stop!!1/10
I never thought this movie would be a masterpiece, I expected it to suck but I also thought I would be entertained and that it would have a few cool moments and at the end of the day be worth the ticket price.
However I was not entertained, this is not fun, and not only does it suck, this is surprisingly badly made."Birds of Prey" is a new wave feminist movie about patriarchy, feminism, and how the world treats its women and how it is female empowering to hit men, blow men up, and kick men in the groin. This concept is given to us in slow motion to obnoxious music by very bad actresses.Margot Robbie is okay, Winstead is okay, Ewan McGregor is okay, all the rest act like they are in a fan made parody of CW's Batwoman.This film's final action sequence is okay, but it is only there to overshadow the lack of direction and hide the fact that we get a head-scratching finish with lots of open threads and hints of future instalments that goes all over the placeMusic is bad, the overuse of slow motion is just annoying, the story bland and boring and cliche, the directing and style reminds me of the worst parts of Suicide Squad, and this is extreme-feminist-cringe, so so cringe.This is the first movie of 2020 I have seen at the theatre and the year could not have started worse.I give it a 2/10 and the only reason I do not give it the lowest score is that a few of the action sequences was okay and a few of the actors okay and some of the cinematography was okay. I cannot recommend this to anyone.






I have been reading DC comics since the mid-90s, actually liked Suicide Squad Extended Edition (it was weirdly comic accurate by the standards of these adaptations) and I love Harley´s new TV-Ma rated cartoon but I had to force myself to pay attention here. The film has little to do with anything, neither the performances nor the visuals stand out and both the direction and writing feel a bit amateurish as they are done by no-name newcomers. I can fully believe that this was a troubled production and I don´t get how any of this cost 85 million to film. Gotham or most of the Marvel shows on Netflix honestly "felt" more expensive.Don´t ask me where the Golden Tomato on RT came from as I struggled to enjoy myself despite being the target audience. The middling Metascore is way more accurate. I don´t necessarily think that the film derives to flop, which it actually might after the abysmal opening weekend, but I honestly don´t care for a sequel either. WB should have done a Gotham City Sirens starring Harley and a Birds of Prey film starring Batgirl instead with seasoned directors and writers. David Ayer and Jared Leto might get the last laughs here, lol. Good luck James Gunn, you might need it.All in all the worst DC life action film since Green Lantern and I would have given the film a full point more if it wasn´t burdened by a cringe inducing narration that can´t stop. 5/10






Despite the bad marketing, the movie is not bad, but to be honest...it's a movie about Harley. Everyone else, pale in front of her.I knew, that there will be feminism, but the whole movie is about feminism, which IMO is too much.I would categorize the movie as DC's version of "Deadpool", but it won't be quite accurate. It must be seen to be understand.There are some pretty creative approaches, some not so much. The story is not very impressive, but I think it's expected.Black Mask got exactly one comicbook scene...kinda. Everything else about him was just...strange.The action is probably the best part of the movie.The music somehow fits into the overall atmosphere, there're 2-3 strikes.Considering that I was expecting to be a total waste of time, I was not disappointed when I left the theatre. I would say, that it's predictable for comicbook fans and just "okay" Harley Quinn movie at best.






This was really mediocre at best. All that was likeable about Harley Quinn was left in Suicide squad. So much was overdone , constant overkill on the theme of she doesn't need a man theme,...but sadly never delivers. "The bird" of prey distracted more than added. So little chemistry. Cheap laughs...if even that.Joker in a R rating worked, because you could follow the story arch. Birds lacked any real story or script. To fill the R rating , they just added the F word arbitrarily throughout. And the movie felt like a DC version of Clockwork Orange in a weak attempt to feel adult like. Instead of feeling edgy, it was more repulsive. And black canaries last second superpower felt triteSuch a pity. Like most I probably rated this movie way higher than it actually was ....because even at this moment,I really want to like the movie.
You will have fun time watching this film, great explanation of the characters and all around good amount amount of action and storytelling. This will be surely an entertaining night for you.






Pretty bad movie. I was not expecting a lot, but more then what was delivered. I'm glad the movie was free for me.






I love marvel. I love DC. Shazam was good. Aquaman was very good. Joker was barely ok. And Birds of Prey is at the bottom of the bottom of all the listed films. If I want color I can go look at a Garden of flowers. I want to be entertained with quality material. OMG did I want to walk out of this movie. The studio will make their money, but it won't be at my expense. You've been warned... you are better off seeing Cats or The Grudge.






The baddest movie of margort Robbie it wasn't good at all , I expected a movie nicer than this






In the beginning, of the movie, the plot is pretty boring, but I kinda like the ending, the plot is too simple, but I didn't expect too much when I saw this movie if my friends invite me to watch this movie again, I gonna say yes!!!






"Birds of Prey" was directed by Cathy Yan, starring Margot Robbie, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Ewan McGregor. After Harley Quinn and the Joker have split up, she joins forces with The Huntress, Black Canary and Renee Montoya in order to save a young pickpocket who stole a diamond from Black Mask.This is Yan's first big feature film and some of the action is actually well choreographed. Unfortunately that's pretty much all the praise I can give the movie. The action is not horribly edited, however it gets very repetitive very quickly and is simply unnecessary violent.After Todd Phillips' "Joker" grossed over one billion dollars at the box office and was nominated for eleven academy awards (most likely winning 2 or more on Sunday) it was obvious for DC to create an R-Rated Universe that is more suited for adults as an equivalent to Marvel's MCU. The problem about Birds of Prey is that it doesn't understand why the gruesome depiction of violence and the controversy about the movie worked for Joker.Whether you liked Joker or not it was safe to say that Birds of Prey was highly unlikely to be able to hold up to Joker's hype and its themes about a descent into madness. As a result I went in with quite low expectations, because this movie was being dumped in February most likely with the intention to have its opening weekend overlap with Oscar night and therefore generating as much hype as possible for DC after Joaquin Phoenix's performance in Joker is going to win Best Actor.Even though I kept my expectations low I was left disappointed with almost every decision of the movie. There is a scene in the first ten minutes of the movie where Harley Quinn jumps on someone else's legs, breaking them. That was the moment I was done and the first of many moments to come that left me shaking my head. The direction, the cinematography and the editing definitely had their moments during some action scenes. The score is decent and the performances are alright, but could have been better if it weren't for very poor writing. The screenplay is neither funny nor is it refreshing or entertaining.I could go on and on about how much I despise this movie and how much it blatantly failed to match Scorsese's influence on the Joker movie and at one point even calling the villain "The Godfather", absolutely disgusting. I would not recommend this movie to anybody.






I saw

I don't know what I was watching






Dear WB studios. So far all the movies you have made is nothing but Definitely Crap, with one exception Wonder Woman. Aquaman just made money for no apparent reason. Anyhow, how you you like to make 10-15 BILLION dollars! All you have to do is SELL DC characters to DISNEY/MARVEL.






As a "D.C." comics fan I see most all of the movies and this latest was a kick butt action style drama with twist and turns as it is a spotlight of bad girls at their best "Birds of Prey: And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn delivers with action and story. Harley Quinn(Margot Robbie) has just split from her boyfriend "The Joker" so she has to spread her wings free and become a free girl! All of this is helped along by a cast of side characters like detective Renee Montoya, Huntress, and the sexy and beautiful black bra wearing Black Canary! However all are tied and wrapped up in a wild card subplot that involves defeating a crazy and sadistic crime lord in Roman Sionis(AKA "Black Mask") and underneath all of this lies the search for a diamond and teenager named Cass(Ella Jay Basco). Aside from all of this the film entertains with violence, action, bombs, and flashbacks that tell character story. Look at this as a bad ass female group as each fight crime and for their own way of life in a gleeful way The costumes are also an eye catch and the dialogue moves the film along well, so if a comic book fan open up to this picture as it's full of antiheroine glory.






Going by Suicide Squad and the whole of DC Extended Universe, I didn't expect much from this movie, but at least it wasn't worse than its predecessor(s). The first half drags on quite a bit, and I don't think all the time jumps were necessary, I had the feeling they did it just for the sake of it, so Margot Robbie could continuously narrate and break the fourth wall (in Deadpool from the X-Men series it was done right, here it kind of falls flat). After a slow start the film picks up in the second half, and has some enjoyable parts, but it would still need a better storyline and more interesting characters to deserve a better rating. I was satisfied with Margot Robbie's and Ewan McGregor's portrayal of their respective roles as Harley Quinn and Roman Sionis, they tried and did the best they could with the screenplay they've been given. Other characters were quite forgettable, and the girl power scenes were not forced down our throats like I thought they would be, so I can't have many complaints there.All in all, it wasn't the disaster I was expecting, and it's not worse than some of the previous DCEU entries (Suicide Squad, Justice League and Aquaman come to mind). I can't quite put my finger on it, but Marvel Cinematic Universe has something that makes the superhero thing work, and you get a lot more invested in their characters, whereas with DCEU you kind of don't care about them. The big thing in MCU is of course also an intertwined story as we learn about Infinity Stones very early on and almost each film has some connection to them, leading us to the epic culmination in Avengers: Endgame, but in DCEU I still can't figure out what are they trying to do with the story and their characters, it might as well not be a shared universe (Justice League was quite disappointing to say the least). Still I see room for improvement and let's hope DC picks up from now on (speaking of DC, Joker last year was great and I am thankful they created a new version through a standalone film, and got rid of the abomination that was in Suicide Squad). Let's see what the future projects bring to the table.






It's an entirely mixed bag...I liked some things about this movie BUT I also HATED a lot. It's more a Harley Quinn film as opposed to truly being a Birds of Prey team film, but it's a serviceable film, kinda...Firstly, the story-telling and editing is all over the place. Very very choppy and it tries hard to be in the style of Tarantino but it just doesn't work, because not everyone can edit and stylize a film like Tarantino himself.That being said Margot Robbie is quite good as is her supporting team who are barely in the film. Like I said, this is more a Harley Quinn film, and the film does a good job developing her and showcasing her quirks, quips and unpredictable personality.Shoutout to Mary Elizabeth Winstead who kills it as Huntress. I liked her the best out of the supporting cast. Jurnee Smollett-Bell is also pretty good in the role of Black Canary. It's unfortunate though her Canary Cry was only used once out of the whole film. It was such a cool moment, more of that would have provided kinetic flare that some of the scenes were severely lacking in.I disliked Cassandra Cain however. I wasn't sold with Ella Jay Basco's performance. I found her to be a nuisance to be honest. Didn't like Rosie Perez's Detective Montoya either. They did take some liberties with her comic-book counterpart and I wasn't quite happy with what they did, and to be honest I didn't feel like Perez gave a good performance. There is a joke in the film that speaks true to how I feel about her acting, as Huntress or Canary states how she carries herself like a standard 80's cop in film/tv and it's quite true, she does act that way.I don't think the film needed Cain in particular, and it could have therefore had more time to develop Huntress and Black Canary. Not sure what the creative team has in mind for Cain in the future but similar to how I felt about Montoya, I wasn't pleased here as I would have preferred a Cassandra Cain closer to her comic counterpart.Wasn't too happy with what they did to Black Mask, a villain I'm quite fond of in the Batman comics but Ewan McGregor is clearly having fun in the role, along with Chris Messina who plays serial killer Victor Zsasz. They are charming yet extremely unnerving. At first it was disappointing to see Black Mask be extremely flamboyant, but strangely I found myself to be entertained by him. I must admit it kinda grew on me and every time I saw McGregor popup I instantly got pulled back into the film.Action is over the top and violent, but it felt kinda empty and that probably has to due with the fact that it felt really really choreographed. I understand the stunt/action coordinator of JOHN WICK was involved, but I believe Keanu Reeves and the entire cast of JOHN WICK had months of training and preparing to the point where Reeves, Halle Berry, etc. can actually be stuntman/woman. To me at least, it looked pretty clear that the cast didn't have enough time to train. Despite that it was still fun seeing Harley break knees of henchmen with her bat, Canary kicking everyone she comes across, and Huntress killing fools with a crossbow.To sum it up, I wouldn't rank this below SUICIDE SQUAD or JUSTICE LEAGUE, but SHAZAM, MAN OF STEEL, and WONDER WOMAN are still the three best DC films so far. I would also rank AQUAMAN above this as well.Also just a fanboy nitpick, but I would have liked to see more connections to the larger DCEU, and I would have liked some connections to Batman, Joker and other stuff happening within the universe. At some point Walter Hamada the new president at WB (who is doing a good job), needs to address the absence of Jared Leto's Joker, Ben Affleck's Batman and Henry Cavill's Superman. Fingers crossed that they work things out with Cavill as Affleck is a lost cause, which is a shame cause with the exception of JUSTICE LEAGUE he is the best Batman on screen. Only time will tell I suppose.2020 is the year of female superheroes and while I didn't exactly hate this movie, I didn't like it either. I'm pretty sure though WONDER WOMAN 1984 and BLACK WIDOW will not disappoint.5/10






C'mon, do better, do make an average movie and tell us we're to be amazed, make an amazing movie and tell us it's average, that way our minds are blown away because of the movie, and not because we put a gun in our mouths because she it's so crap - do better.






Some movies decide to bring you along slowly, they setup the plot and bring you in by introducing you to the key players. Other movies kick the door open and grab you to take you along for the ride. Birds of Prey is decidedly one of the latter cases. We begin with an animated intro being narrated by Harley (Margot Robbie) where the audience is showered with cursing, violence and frenetic jokes. This was disarming for me and it helped me start laughing right off the bat. Its an odd choice to be sure but this isn't a movie that's ashamed or trying to hide what it is and I respected that choice. It also introduces the visual sensibility of the movie. It borrows from Suicide Squad but they do a good job cherry picking what worked from that movie and they leave behind the less desirable parts. The character cards are back with a couple of twists and the world is decidedly grimy and less glamorous which was a nice change of setting.My favourite aspect of the movie was the script, there's enough story to establish stakes and provide our characters with a common goal. Then the roller coaster picks up speed and we hit the ground running. The dialogue is quick and full of moments that left me chuckling or outright laughing, the emphasis is on a more realistic endgame instead of the end of the world (something that I've been beating a drum about whenever we get a superhero film) and the character intros have a nice mix of cool backstory but they take the time to show us what they're capable of and what they're about. It perfectly embodies Harley's nature (crazy, funny but you can't turn away) and screenwriter Christina Hodson deserves more kudos for her work.There are serious moments in Birds of Prey but there's more emphasis on the action and comedy. The action scenes here are memorable and they hold their own despite this not being a top dollar budget kind of blockbuster (the budget is still high at around 85 million but when you put that up against the Avengers movies, doesn't seem so big eh?). They aren't carbon copies, there's a dream sequence that's part action setpiece and musical number that felt like somebody slipped me something and the scene in the police station is so unconventional because they weave the narrative structure into how the scene plays out. They kept me engaged and it was also nice to be dealing with heroes that didn't have to rely on super powers and could really hold their own based on physical prowess.As much as this is pitched as an ensemble (it really isn't but I digress) Robbie is the star of the show and she proves that her fan favourite work in Suicide Squad wasn't a fluke. This isn't a dignified or glamorous role, much like her work as Tonya Harding, she gets into the uglier side of the character. Harley's really fun for a few seconds and then she'll do something disappointing or shocking and because of Robbie's work, she becomes a more well rounded character. She captures Harley's enigmatic nature and this is a triumph for her. If there's someone who really caught my attention other than our lead it was Jurnee Smollett-Bell as Black Canary. She not only looked the part but she had the tough attitude and the vulnerability all wrapped up into one. I had only seen her in Temptation (which I also liked her in but the movie sucked overall) but she was excellent here and I hope we get to see more of her again in this role soon. Rosie Perez and Mary Elizabeth Winstead were both solid, they were the supporting players in the crew but they each got their moments (more on Winstead later). I was so sure going in I was going to hate Cassandra Cain as a character but Ella Jay Basco hit the right notes and I thought she worked well with the rest of the cast. Kid characters get annoying fast when they're not done right and she was a good addition to this group. I want to credit Chris Messina as a pitch perfect Victor Zsasz but I also have to talk about our antagonist Roman Sionis played by Ewan McGregor. This is a weird performance by Ewan, he's so off-kilter and his tone changes from scene to scene. He's a great actor and he won me over but I had a hard time getting a handle on what he was trying to do. But I still think he did a good job overall.The strengths of Birds of Prey shine so brightly that it helped me look past a couple of things that bothered me. The movie does start to lose a little momentum at the 3/4 point, its pace had been very frenetic and breezy but when the emotional stakes come in, they hit the breaks a little too hard. I liked the character of Huntress and Winstead's performance but we could have used more time with her, she could almost have been cut out of the movie. I also didn't like the score, the musical choices were very obvious and while I like that style of music, the movie featuring so many classic rock/pop hits made the music feel more generic next to the rest of the movie.This movie isn't a perfect package and while I did walk away with notes and criticism but I was so happy leaving the theatre. Birds of Prey doesn't just break away from the rest of the DC Universe, it blazes a brand new trail. It has more in common with Doom Patrol and Deadpool than Batman v Superman or Aquaman and it was so refreshing and unafraid to switch things up. Robbie throws herself into Harley, the plot shifts constantly and keeps you guessing, the action holds up and our heroine's zany humour is not only plentiful but brilliantly successful. As much as Margot deserves credit, Prey's MVP is screenwriter Christina Hodson who delivers a bonkers script that throws curve after curve (along with some solid comedic dialogue) and when paired with Yan's direction, Birds of Prey is a home run. Purists may have issues with the representation of a couple of the characters but I don't have that background. I'm happy to give Birds of Prey an 8.5/10 rounding up to a 9/10. I would absolutely recommend checking this out in the theatre, this kind of entry in the genre is the best way to fight superhero blockbuster fatigue. My message to the executives is that if you want people to keep showing up to see the big comic book movies, we need different and daring films which Birds of Prey is unabashedly so.






The movie is just.....a mess! 5/10 just because of Harley and Black Mask, but the rest is just.... well...... not good enough to even see a 2nd time. They really must do a Harley solo movie asap, because this ones are terrible.






This is the most stupid movie I ever seen.. The plot of the movie it's worst...






Good character development for the birds. But black mask lacks it.
Fight scene are beautiful to watch.
Story is above average.






OMG i didnt think i would make it till the end but somehow i survived. the fighting scenes were horrendous. you could tell there was a lot of editing in the fighting scenes. this was a movie for ppl who already knew about the birds of prey. boring, i would not watxh again






Women good / white men bad! Nice job! #overthis"Watching the movie, I felt an intense pang for something I yearn for and am still not finding as often as I'd like - art by and for and about women that doesn't feel the need to prove it can keep up with the boys, because it doesn't worry about what the boys think at all." Alison Willmore Wrote- NOT THIS FILM!






The entire First Act is just needless exposition and feminism. In the Second Act absolutely nothing important to the plot happens. And the Third Act is just a big fight. I loved Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn, Ewan McGregor as Roman Sionis and Chris Messina as Victor Zsasz. Black Canary was just, annoying. Renee Montoya had no personality whatsoever. Cassandra Cain was not Cassandra Cain and any potential they had with exploring her character was dropped as soon as production started. And I cannot will not and should not explain how much I hate Huntress






No need for a lot of talk it just bad and boring yes margrot did a great job but still it's so badly written






DONT LISTEN TO THOSE BAD REVIEWS. JUST WATCH IT. It's definitely worth to watch.






I came in thinking this cannot be worse than Suicide Squad but it proved me wrong. Who wrote this nonsense ??
It was a wanna be Deadpool John Wick hybrid and it failed on every single level. Margot Robbie was great but there is only so much you can do with this cringey dialogue.






Start to finish this movie did exactly what we needed it to do be amazing and it did I don't know what's with the bad reviews but this flick was a powerhouse of action comedy and plain old fun






I hate how they ruin zasz and black mask I'm disappointed they made this film. There is no batman, joker is cut out, and everyone look bad.






Birds of pray is so much fun! You Harley is out there kicking ass like crazy, I feel like it corrected a lot of things that suicide squad failed to do!
Had so many great fight scenes and was a lot of fun!
I knew it had a MA rating but didn't think it would live up to it! But it did had some really full on scenes.
Hopefully dc can see that this is the way and will push for a less kid friendly Audience, all the birds of prey cast where really good didn't hate any of them, Ewan McGregor stands out as the woman hating mask loving germ he is! What they do with him is the only thing that makes me alittle upset but he was amazing in this film as the rest of the cast! Big shout out to Mary Elizabeth winstead! Loved huntress a lot would love to see a lot more of her!!
No words to describe such a terrible movie!

Saw the movie yesterday. I would say it is a nice one Time watch but overall nothing too exciting for me. The movie started a little confusing and kind of slow story wise but it picked up the pace from the 2/3. The fight scenes are nice and hilarious. Would have expected a more entertaining final fight scene because of the previous fight scenes but overall a good watch!






I didn't have any great expectation in the plot or anything, went to the movie just to see Harley Quinn. But it was unexpectedly entertaining. People in the theatre were laughing bcs it was so fun. The asthetic was pleasing too. My two friends who aren't DC fans also like it. It was a great that the great part wasn't only the Harley Quinn.






This debacle of a movie from start to finish, absolutely makes men look like bumbling idiots or evil tyrants! There is not one single male character in here that is worth liking or even worth caring about! Massive fail and missed opportunities. It's like Ghostbusters 2016 2.0.
This is the final nail in the coffin for me, I will never watch another Marvel movie or DC picture for the rest of my life.






Same writer from the movie Bumblebee, so the plot is as pathetic as it can be as expected. And it felt like the director knows nothing about how to pace a movie.






This one is good,probably best in DC universe of late.
I was pleasantly surprised by this film it's funny it's quirky.
it has all that to be a very entertaining ride.






This movie was not very good. It's almost as bad as the Harley Quinn tv series. I didnt care for it at all... I love DC movies but mostly the animated features now. They did do well with aquaman and wonder woman but this film was garbage.






Do not waste your time everything about this film was bad






Yep, this movie really is that bad. It's Tank Girl for the modern era. They went for irreverent cheese and delivered the worst of both. The male bad guy is completely and intentionally one note and it's as annoying as it gets. Alienating the main portion of your fandom is as asinine as the plot itself. I also hated the entire supporting cast. It was complete nails on a chalkboard. One point for Margot and one point for the coke scene and nothing for anything else. Avoid this movie if you have active brain cells.






I would like to say that your only fault is to disrespect comics blatantly ... It is an absolute cinematographic disaster at the level of Sucker Punch and Bitch Slap, blatantly copies Deadpool's formula and abuses it with flashbacks that noble bring nothing dynamic to the plot, the plot is mediocre at best, the costumes are disastrous ( I do not say it because it is not sexualized) there are better street cosplay than those who are part of the cast, I do not understand why they try to inflate the character of Black Canary if it is the worst in the movie? A flat character without any charisma, the action scenes especially the combat choreographies are ridiculous (it is really incredible to see that in the middle of a shooting the protagonists do not receive a single shot going practically in front of the weapons), a film that does not I recommend seeing






The end was the beginning in this film when the actual birds of prey got together, before that was a complete mishmash. It's leading up to a possible sequal, no thanks I didn't get what I paid for as the trailers are misleading. Roman was just another crazy idiot a cheap joker if you will. The film and characters got on my nerves.
I wasn't a fan of DC until Gal Gadot brought "Wonder Woman" to life (and which I proceeded to see three times in the theatre), and didn't see "Suicide Squad" when it first came out. I watched it last weekend to prepare for this one, and it wasn't as bad as I had expected. Despite Margot Robbie continuing to be an incredibly compelling screen presence, that alone wasn't enough to save this from being a mildly stinky pile of poo.I always hate being negative about a film written by a woman and directed by a woman and featuring five badass women in the climactic fight scene, since we're still sorely lacking in representation. But it's hard to be overly positive about a shabbily written and derivatively directed movie that made me feel kind of icky and that while offering slight entertainment, ended up curdling into unpleasant and unbelievable girl power run amok. The casting was great and diverse and Margot Robbie made a really unpleasant character somewhat less awful. It was also fun to see an older Rosie Perez still holding her own against the youngins, and I loved Jurnee Smollett-Bell as Black Canary. But unless you're a diehard DC fan, there isn't much reason to see this.






Dear director Cathy Yan, exactly what was the marching orders when it came to this movie? To out-Schumacher Joel Schumacher?
This movie is as schizophrenic as the lead character Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) straight after a breakup with the non-existent Mr. J. Or Joker if you're nasty.
Immediately antennas should perk up as to how a jilted love burned woman should react. Naturally it's to draw attention to herself.
The often adorably huggable Harley is the result. Now the story jumps back and forth, rewinds and is told through so many different timelines and perspectives that what ends up being is that you realize their gimmick is to hide an incredibly thin plot of a pickpocket kid who heists a very important diamond that a vicious crime boss wants. That in the form of Black Mask (Ewan MacGregor).
Now it's a simple line made to be more complicated then it should.
I admit I did laugh once in this entire...well, messy tale. Which I figured it would be a laugh out loud dark comedy. It's not. It's very self aware and mean. And the entire time you are thinking...where is Batman? Where is Commissioner Gordon, and are we REALLY in Gotham? Awful thoughts to have.
Also a middle aged Rosie Perez will not be able to take care of herself. The other "human" person is that of Dinah Lance (Jumee Smollett-Bell) who I desperately wanted to like. She isn't funny and delivers lines like she's passing gas. Not fun at all. The brightest spot is emo'd out Helena Bertinelli played with a great deal of subdued frazzled trauma adult Mary Elizabeth Winstead. Doing what, I presume, Audrey Plaza probably could knock out of the park. I love M.E.W. but...she is given so very little.
The rest turns into an oddball circus that amounts to nothing but a lot of loud grrl rock over them kicking men's butts. There seems to be another movie buried under this one.
I became a huge fan of Christina Hodson after "Bumblebee" Somehow she captured the sweet innocence of the 80's in that one. In this, it feels like she is shoehorning a tough gal action flick but not knowing what makes a revenge story so satisfying. We don't feel for Harley at all. Which I think is because they are handcuffed to horrible legacy of fandom. There is a moment when she gets betrayed by a side character, and I am lost as to how, in her sociopathic/psychopathic nature it effects her. Perhaps it's borderline personality that drives her. But we never see that. Unfortunately, they want us to like unlikeable person.
Ella Jay Basco, who plays the Diamond pickpocket'r, Cassandra Cain is awful. Sorry, kid your screen presence is as welcomed as poison ivy. She is ungrateful and bratty and...yeah, we get it, she's suppose to remind Harley of herself. But she's obnoxious and I'm not sure director Yan understands the difference.
As I went for fun, this offered an empty shallow painful all tell and no-show. A very simple diversion for a boring February. Not a disaster but a disappointment.
Listen I thought suicide squad was absolutely a huge misfire but just wait till you lay your eyes upon this travesty. Once again we bear witness to easily one of the worst actresses around in Margot Robbie playing easily the most annoying portrayal of a comic book character once again. They somehow managed to make this into a feminist film which is not surprising and they dance on any true accuracy of being faithful to the subject matter. Ewan McGregor is maybe the one saving grace as black mask but even his character is misrepresented in this mess of a film. This will no doubt be a box office bomb and looked at is even worse than suicide squad if you can imagine that.






I super LOVED this movie! Everything was awesome and better than I could have hoped for. Margot Robbie gave a complex portrayal. Huntress, Black Canary, Montoya were all super great! This is one of the best super hero movies ever! Also that egg sandwich and Captain Boomerang!






The movie didn't give me action or comedy or anything its the badest movie of 2020






Let's get something straight for the record. Birds of Prey, though it serves as a spin-off of the celluloid abortion known as Suicide Squad, is not even close to being as bad as it's predecessor. It's watchable, at least for it's majority. It even has some sort of awareness of how unwanted Suicide Squad is, as it blows off Jared Leto's cringe-inducing Joker rendition by portraying him as an albatross around Harley's neck, and barely a blip on the radar of her own special insanity. As a result, BOP assuredly, though awkwardly, steps out from the rubble as something of its own. Unfortunately for everyone involved, no matter how much they tried to scrub it off, the Suicide Squad stink lingers on. To make matters worse, this film couldn't have premiered at a more inconvenient time. The DC cinematic universe has changed forever with Joker, proving that superhero movies can stir and spellbind the filmgoing public without being flashy and action packed. Joker isn't just good, it's 11 Oscar nominations good. Birds of Prey now just feels irrelevant. Almost as if it was shelved for three years. Hey, it wouldn't have been the first film release of 2020 to feel older (see The New Mutants).As for the substance, Birds of Prey has something to prove. It wants to be a female Deadpool. It's wants to be cartoonish and whip-smart, but woke. It's struggles to be either. Without a doubt, Margot Robbie is the star of the show. She's a lightening rod, and a badass. She was born to play Harley Quinn. Everyone else is just along for the ride, and it shows. The other female fatales are tragically forgettable. I can't even remember all of their names. Girl power is a group effort, and if you can't do that, than just keep Harley as the sole focus of your movie. Not to mention, every character here, besides Harley, is one-dimensional. Most especially, our villain, Black Mask. He's a misogynistic prick. That's it. No depth, no backstory, none of that. He's a cartoon bad guy. Maybe that was the point. But again, for a film so "progressive", it's so stuck in the past. Even as a comedy, it's lopsided. The jokes land, especially when they have to, only to disappear and then reappear unexpectedly. Deadpool worked, because it kept firing jokes at a rapid pace. That's what BOP needed to do. All in all, it's just ok. It really didn't have to be, though. Too bad, puddin!






Poorly written and edited - but for the most part reasonably acted.
Reasonable soundtrack.Too verbose and with conversations that could and should have been cut back significantly without affecting what was trying to be conveyed.Illogical, Wildly unbalanced execution and content of the fight scenes
Not funny enough.Too much tell rather than show.Mates scored it as a 'five' given that the female actors looked 'good in hot pants' so also failed in selling its Wokeness.
I'm giving it a 5 as I can't go below average as in that area you find '6 Underground'
Need to reconsider my scoring system.Just about Meh






This movie is okay. It's just okay. It's a movie that you don't really like much but don't hate much to want to leave. I went to this movie with two people of large age difference. They loved it and even dared to say it was better than Joker (2019). At that moment I had an epiphany: most people care about the visuals and action; not the script. This movie is your average blockbuster all brawn and no brain. Moreover, it was not in any way, shape or form better than Suicide Squad, let alone Joker. The plot was a joke. The only redeeming factor was the few adrenaline rush moments.






I'm not going to lie, I went into this movie with very low expectations. And it was still terrible.First of all, this film should have been called "Harley Quinn, feat. Birds of Prey". This movie was all about Harley. The title and the premise would make you believe that this movie is the origin of an iconic female superhero team, but nah. I suppose if you followed their promotion it would have been pretty obvious from the start that this would be all about Harley but still. Misleading title if you ask me. The other ladies are barely there, and Harley steals the spotlight for pretty much the whole film. And not just because of Margot's portrayal, no. She gets all the spotlight because that's how this film was written. The other girls get lackluster introductions that fail to catch your attention. And adding to that, they then get barely any screen time, and like NO character development. I'm a fan of the Birds of Prey comics, and of Black Canary. So I already know a lot about these characters. But for a film that was meant to introduce these characters to a larger audience and give them their big screen debut, it was an absolute failure. And the formation of the /team/ itself was rushed and they REALLY try to sell it to you but just no. Teams don't just form at the snap of a finger. Yes, it takes a dire situation like being surrounded by several thugs that forces you to decide that you need to team up to beat them. But like.. they just got along?? just like that?? No actual conflict. They don't show how the team develops trust between one another, how they get to know each other. Nope. We're just meant to believe that they are this amazing team. I'm all for female empowerment but that is just flat out bad writing.The one good thing about this film for me was Roman Sionis, Black Mask. Ewan McGregor killed it. His scenes were striking and always got your attention. You WANTED to see more of him everytime he shows up on screen. I loved it! He was so mesmerizing to me, I have no other way to put it into words. He was the only successful element in this film for me, and even his screentime was less than it should have been, if you ask me. And on top of that, KILLED OFF?? already?? Like guys.. the one good thing that came out of this mess of a film, and he's already just gone? Ewan did a great job with the role and I would have love to see him return in future projects, especially with the Batman pretty much right around the corner. That was a major disappointment for me.Margot as Harley was the same as usual. She's good at portraying Harley. A lot of people say that her role along with Black Mask's is what stuck out. Well, for me, initially in Suicide Squad, I absolutely adored Harley. She's still great, don't get me wrong. I just think her whole /quirky/ thing got old by now? Sure, she develops a little bit by the end of this film due to her relationship with Cass, but I'm kind of over Harley already. I really didn't need another film centred entirely on her. I wish they'd have given some of that screentime to the other ladies.Speaking of Cassandra. Ha. Ha. I am a BIG fan of Batman and the Batfam, as it is called by fans. I had high hopes for a character as complex, with so many layers as Cassandra. and they messed it up. Royally. They turned a badass master assassin, who works under the Dark Knight himself into this child character who in all honesty, wasn't all that interesting. She seemed like a typical kid character who has a rough background and grows into a life of petty thieving blah blah. Just didn't think she was all that great. She just was what she was meant to be. But just another example of wasted potential in the DCEU. Sad, really. Cassandra really could have been something, and this was an underwhelming introduction for an iconic Batman character.As for the plot itself: mediocre and I don't mean to be rude, but I giant, stupid mess. No structure. Does not really engage the audience or steal your attention. The visuals were stunning but that's about the only thing that kept me looking at the screen.TL/DR: movie was a mess. was less about BoP, and literally just Harley feat. /the girls/, but McGregor as Black Mask was a positive that came out of it.
Seen a lot of movies in my days. Of course this is not really a movie it's a feminist garbage house of what is wrong with society!






Sigh... where do I start?!It's an okay picture with some really good shots and sequences. That's it! Nothing more it's not a classic and not a "super hero" movie and not your typical action movie.They tried so hard to be everything that they failed to be one good thing.I felt the same with suicide squad, I thought DC would follow the same direction of wonder woman and man of steel, but still trying to be something which they are not and throw mess all over the place.






I wanted to like, I promise I did.BUUUUUT... it just ain't it.No offense to Cathy Yen, she had no business filming fight/action scenes. They were so bland and uninspiring. Her overall photography looked less impressive than a show on TNT. And that's not a knock against the fine programming on Turner's flagship network.Margo phone'd her performance and her fight choreography in. She was so inconsistent with her signature Harley accent and when she did use it, was vastly watered down.That was NOT Victor Zazas!I was so tired of hearing Joker's name evoked, it got as obnoxious as the directionless plot.Black Mask was the brightest spot of the whole feature, then maybe that charlatan of a Cassandra Cain.I can go on and on but I'll end this by saying, Suicide Squad was better.






Not a fan of this movie. Then again I have not been a fan of this harley quinn at all and thought robbie was a horrible casting choice in suicide squad and if your in that same boat this movie will only cement your opinion. The movie is over the top and not in the good way. Plays to alot of troupes. Ignores the characters truly remarkable past and the update to her looks makes her trashier then ever. I'd say its sad when the animated series is better then this movie but that's the way it seems to be d.c. If your looking to be drowned by stale humor and bad writing this movies for you but if your looking for a decent portrayal of harley quinn since t.a.s. I'd recommend the new animated harley quinn show.






Edith Piaf would turn around in her grave if she would know that this piece of soulless cheap Hollywood garbage is brought into relation with her beautiful music that comes directly from the soul. Just finished watching The Red Turtle that I scored a 10/10, and would honestly prefer to score Birds of Prey a -10/10. Why don't people understand the difference between cinematography as an art-from and cinematography used as a cash-cow to fund scum like Harvey Weinstein.






I always stay to see after credits if there is one, but I just wasn't interested in this one. It's that big "whatever" of a movie.It seems DCEU is just not meant to be and work it's kinks out. I mean this is like, seventh or eighth movie or something along those lines and only Shazam and WW were worth a damn.As for the movie itself, it's mostly boring, plot is really thin and stupid, acting is okay for the most part. However, tempo, editing and general cohesion of the film itself is all over the place, trying to hide it's flaws with very messy storytelling.About mid runtime, there's a police station action scene, and it actually looked like it's finally gonna kick into the higher gear and start to be a good movie. But no, after that, it got boring again. Jokes are all but one - bad, flat. The only chuckle I had was during "They call me... " bits with Huntress.I don't think Black Mask is a good villain in general, however, this movie's version is probably the worst. For a guy that calls himself "Black Mask" he wears it - and I'm not kidding - for 20 seconds, tops, throughout the whole movie. He's kinda wacky, but really isn't.
As for the main "hero" cast, Jurnee's Black Cannary was probably the best character in it. But the camera is mostly pointed at Harley Quinn and, man, she's just try-too-hard, tiresome after a while.One more thing that I noticed, everyone is dressed so ugly, and the movie itself looks ugly, nondescript.For a time, I've actually expected at least fun movie, it really didn't have to be good, just fun. Instead, it was boring, not super bad, just boring, underdeveloped... like the DCEU itself.






I'm comparing this movie to DC's other villain flick, Joker. Harley Quinn is trash, but has some fun moments.The story is incoherent. The character motives are nonsense. All male characters are stupid and evil (every single one). There's no development of the characters at all. The violence is meaningless and cartoonish.So, why is this movie ok? Margot Robbie plays her part well. Some (not all) of the action scenes are well done and interesting. However, it's not enough to rescue this film.If you're bored and want senseless violence, consider watching this flick. Otherwise, just skip it. It's not for comic fans or male audiences. Not sure who it's for really. The women I respect would not watch this film.






Marvel has raised our expectations guys. Always feels like DC half asses it. Poor plot, mediocre humor, another lost opportunity.






This movie really disappointed me. The best part of the movie is Harley Quinn. They made black mask this club dude and made him a werido. What I like about black mask in the comics is that he's a tough mafia boss. This movie wasted a interesting villain the only good thing about black mask in this movie is the mask that's the only thing this movie did right with black mask also the black Canary actress didn't feel like black Canary she acted nothing like her just bad and the plot is sloppy.






Great characters but that is it.
Good story with episodes but not enough story line for movie.
editing need more time.
Learn more from Wonder woman, and Marvel Universe.
HOP .....
Not hope of DC.
hope only from Wonder woman 1984 for DC






BIRDS OF PREY AND THE FANTABULOUS EMANCIPATION OF ONE HARLEY QUINN is well made and undeniably entertaining, but utterly inconsequential. It's the cinematic equivalent of candy floss - bright, colourful and tastes good while you're consuming it, but afterwards you're still hungry and in need of actual proper food. It's completely Margot Robbie's movie - despite the Birds of Prey getting top billing in the title, the film should more accurately be called 'Harley Quinn: The Movie' - and the fanbases of both the actress and the character won't be disappointed. That said, most of the other main cast-members are given the chance to shine, though Mary Elizabeth Winstead draws the short straw - as Huntress, she's only properly introduced four-fifths of the way through the film, isn't given enough time to make any kind of impression, and only seems to be there to take part in the all-action climax. Speaking of the action scenes, they're particularly well-executed, with Harley's solo Terminator-style assault on a police station being the highlight, followed by her dispatching of a team of mercenaries in the evidence room while Echo Chamber's cover of 'Black Betty' blares out on the soundtrack. Unfortunately, the climactic battle between all the Birds and Black Mask's amassed henchmen in an abandoned & forgotten amusement park funhouse is disappointingly somewhat messy and disorientated in comparison.
I seen Birds of prey last night with the girlfriend. I convinced her to go see it with me, I loved Margot Robbie in suicide squad she done a brilliant performance in that. I wish the same could be said about birds of prey. The script was awful and the lack of imagination in it was disappointing. The acting scenes and the comedy was just terrible they made it boring. I wish the screenwriter put some thought into it or just got a different screenwriter. A better director as well maybe.






As a fan of superhero films, I'm now bored of them as they are just shoving same formula and giving us repetitive crap. But Birds of Prey felt fresh and was something new.Without spoiling much I'd only say that trailers didn't show much. The movie has lots of amazing action sequence and perfect balance of action and comedy. I'm glad they made the film R rated. Hats off to DC and WB for pushing boundary, take risk and give us something new everytime. Now after films like joker and Birds of prey, I'm really excited for upcoming films like WW84, Batman, etcAlso ignore the drama by haters as movie isn't about that at all.






The movie starts here then goes there then back here then goes there then back to there before going over there then back to here. After that its okay. The rating was unnecessary because other than some curse words and a little violence it was just an average movie. Very average. If you're bored and have nothing to do then check around and make sure you absolutely have nothing to do and then if its still nothing then it'll be okay to spend that hour and 46 minutes. It'll pass the time. You'll get a couple of chuckles but not seeing it you miss absolutely nothing.Pure time passer.






After Suicide Squad split DC fans down the middle, one might've assumed that Harley Quinn's story in the DCEU was over. It wasn't.Birds of Prey delivers a stunning new look at the DCEU. It's additions of Black Canary, Huntress, and Renée Montoya provide a new type of character develop that we've never seen in DC movies before. In addition to Black Mask, this badass team of superheroes provides a perfect blend of insanity, awkwardness, and that feeling of total badass you get from watching the team plow through Black Mask's entire army.Of course, I couldn't close off this review without mentioning Margot Robbie's stellar performance as the siren herself. Nobody else could possibly pull off Harley like she does.






There's no denying its sense of energy and enthusiasm, something that was amiss in the previous Harley Quinn starring Suicide Squad but for all its colour, flair and style, Birds of Prey can't overcome a so-so plot (a major trouble for a lot of DC films), a sense of repetitiveness and a feeling that everything is a slightly too try-hard for this "girls on a mission" to ever get into full flight.Undoubtedly a labour of love for its leading lady and producer Margot Robbie, who was the ringmaster behind this whole affair getting off the ground, Prey gives its leading lady a large portion of the spotlight and for anyone that thought Robbie stole the show in the mostly forgettable Suicide Squad, they're in for a real treat as Robbie chews scenery, feeds hyenas, cracks skulls (and multiple legs/ankles) and eats delicious looking egg and bacon sandwiches on her quest to recover from her breakup with Mr. J and fight for her survival after local crime boss Roman Sionis decides Quinn's time on this earth is up.A lot of advance press and marketing has focussed around how Prey is all about the team up of Quinn and new additions to this side of the DC movie universe, Rosie Perez's novelty t-shirt wearing detective Renee Montoya, Mary Elizabeth Winstead's Huntress, Jurnee Smollett-Bell Black Canary and Ella Jay Basco's Cassandra Cain but for anyone expecting a true ensemble flick, you'll be left disappointed as the films more three quarters Quinn show and one quarter squad-up as director Cathy Yan struggles to get her story moving before the half-way mark.There's a lot going on in Prey, in many ways it feels conflicted as to what it wants to be.Is it a dark comedy? A crime film? An expose on finding oneself in this mad crazy world? Whatever it's true intentions are it's hard for us to care or focus on any one particular thing as we fly between scenes, some with comical but also wince inducing violence, scenes with Ewan McGregor's big bad getting to swear and chew scenery but not do too much at all (bar one particularly awkward sequence involving a customer of his nightclub) or other supposedly feel good moments between Quinn and her teenage pickpocket off-sider Cassandra.None of the stories components ever feel as though they combine into one cohesive and gripping whole and while they all share the same sense of bombastic and loud delivery that is at all times accompanied by either a terribly hand-picked soundtrack or Daniel Pemberton's incessantly over the top score, Prey never feels like a film that is heading towards any genuinely interesting destination or end goal as it seems content to allow its self-aware winking at camera or audience directed voice-overs to do the work for it.It is a shame for not just the film but for the future of this type of solo/team-up Quinn adventure as Robbie remains the perfect fit for Harley's loopy delivery and some of the films action beats and stylistic capturing by D.O.P Matthew Libatique are fantastic but it all takes place around a rocky road of bad plots, half-cooked ideas and a feeling that for all its hype, this team up movie never even feels like we get the payoff of seeing a bunch of intriguing characters shining together in their quest to show the world these baddies can match it with the big boys.Final Say -Barely pausing for breath, Birds of Prey is a frenetic and colourful comic book adaptation but despite the best efforts of its leading lady, this newest addition to the DC universe is both forgettable and disappointing, failing to establish its posse of death bringers in a way that makes us want more.2 snot bubbles out of 5






Just garbage....fight scenes were ok. Black Mask could have been used better in an actual Batman movie.
I was expecting a fantabulous disaster like Suicide Squad, but its actually better than not only Suicide Squad, but a lot of the DC movies that have been released lately. Margot Robbie is terrific as the lovable, but slightly psychotic hit girl with a heart of gold. The film is boasted with a well rounded cast of characters with great performances and chemistry. The film looks great, with decent cinematography and a bold and increasingly saturated color pallete. The action sequences are fun, surprisingly gory, and well helmed to the point where its not distracting. It's a fun movie but not without its fair share of flaws. Some of the characters dont receive the spotlight as much as others, and I was disappointed with Ewan McGregor's Black Mask. The actor himself looks as if he's having a blast, but his character is not compelling, and he's reduced to generic bad guy number 1. Either way, it's a decent movie.






I love Harley Quinn but I wasn't really excited about this movie. But I watched it and I love it! The movie is crazy, it's fun and the action scenes are just amazing, so are the characters. All of them have their story told and all of them have their moments in this movie. Harley's personality is just like the comics and cartoons! And the movie also has Suicide Squad references! The soundtrack is amazing too. But I thought that Bruce would have more screen time and a scene from the trailer it's not in the movie... But I love it anyway!






I would rather have a vasectomy than watch that movie again.






I thought the film was kind of meh. First of all the film kind of takes awhile to get to the main plot. We start off with basically a montage/narration of the stuff Harley is doing post-breakup. You get a Suicide Squad style of announcing the characters you're gonna meet. The movie evenually gets to a point where Harley shows up at a police station and then the narration basically goes "I need to tell you how I ended up here" and we go back in time to an earlier point in the film. This is the moment where I thought to myself "This is seriously taking awhile to get to this film's meat and potatoes. Is there no way they could have streamlined this? So anyway, you eventually get all caught up and brought up back to the current timeline. Its also within the same police station sequence that has some bad fight choreography. Like the typical everyone stand back while the protagonist fights off everyone one by one lameness. There's also a scene where Harley gets hit in the head and has a Marilyn Monroe sequence and I thought "Why?". It ends nothing to the film. It's just filler. There was other stuff to, things you'll have to suspend disbelief over, stuff like that.I also did not care for Ewan McGregor's character Black Mask. He was too cartoony. I mean, one might argue that Harley Quinn is pretty cartoony herself...but it works for her character. I just didnt find Black Mask to be threatening in any way. He was just silly. I was more disturbed by his right hand man played by Chris Messina. There wasn't really enough of Huntress for me to feel a connection to her. I thought Jurnee as Black Canary was good. I did really like Rosie Perez and felt like she was the second standout of the film for me. But of course Margot is the star of the film and she is really good at being Harley.I dont think the film was totally bad. There were some stuff that genuinely made me laugh and smile. And I did really the scenes and action when they finally got all together to fight (though this is towards the end of the film).But unfortunately moments dont really make a movie. Having some kick-ass moments or some funny lines doesnt really undo the pacing issues, some of the cringy dialogue and acting...and the very basic story. If Im being honest, I think this another miss on DC's list.






Well despite Margot Robbie's performance which was actually good since she was Quinn the rest was really bad. Not a plot that makes sense, almost 1.5 hour of nonsense fighting with overpowered girls and a bad guy that tried his best to fail at it. Tbh I was anticipating this movie since I saw the spoilers but it disappointed me in all ways.






Don't be fooled by some of the reviews. ALOT of fragile men have it out for this film.However, I thought it was AMAZING. I love that it isn't the same plot that every other superhero movie has. The world isn't ending in this one and that's a good thing. This movie is much more grounded which allows for a totally different experience. The delivery is a little crazy but makes perfect since for a movie staring Harley Quinn.The cast is phenomenal. Jurnee as Black Canary was my favorite part. The action sequences are really good and DIFFERENT. That's the best thing about this movie. It's not the same superhero movie with different characters. I had a blast and so will you!






I didn't like the the story is been told.
Boring, no real action.






People are so fast to trash movies now days. There wasn't bad CGI the storyline was a little bit all over but easy to follow. Harley was great awesome to see black mask in something. It was sassy and fun I loved it.






Given the early predictions, many have been questioning whether this movie will live up to its expectations or not. Many have also said that in their reviews and comments, the trailer is bad, and that the clips of the movie shown are also bad.The Birds of Prey follows Harley Quinn's journey after a recent breakup with the Joker along with Renee Montoya, The Huntress, Black Canary, and Cassandra Cain. Harley finds herself a target by everyone that She and the Joker targeted whether its just for fun, unintentional and intentional.Roman Sionis or Black Mask is known to be one of the top mercenary in Gotham, and also the one who hate Harley the most, after a series of events that Harley and Joker had done to him. But given that Harley was still under the protection of the Joker, no one else dared to mess with her. But after the breakup Harley finds herself on the top of Ronan's kill list.I'll give you guys the points of the film which I like..The Soundtrack, every single track on this film made me gag, it complements the film's action scenes like Halsey's "Experiment on Me."And speaking of the Action Scenes, you may think that they look sloppy and less energetic because of the comments and reviews, but once you watch the film its definitely has something else in its reportoire. As for the R-Rated category, yes its somewhat gory (like the torture scene) andThe Creativity and Aesthetic, instead of simply using a gun shot blast they thought of a creative way, with glitters and paints. I personally love the scene where Harley fights the Prisoners inside the cell with the sprinklers set off.The Humor, Not only can this film serve looks and action, but it can also serve you the humor.Bad reviews or not, I stand by my own opinion, and for me its definitely WORTH THE MONEY.
Birds Of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn) is a superhero film based on the DC Comics team of the same name and a sequel/spin-off to 2016's Suicide Squad. Starring Margot Robbie in the lead role as Harley Quinn, it is a fast-paced, violent, and sometimes disjointed follow-up with varying degrees of entertainment value.Sometime after the events of Suicide Squad, the Joker and Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) have since ended their relationship, resulting in the latter being forced to fend for herself out on the streets of Gotham City. After spending a night at a fancy club, Harley attracts the attention of its owner Roman Sionis (Ewan McGregor), a sadistic crime lord who holds a high position of power over the entire city. In exchange for her life, Roman tasks Harley with tracking down a young girl named Cassandra Cain (Ella Jay Basco), who has pickpocketed an important diamond containing crucial information that will further his influence. Upon finding Cassandra, Harley decides that the two of them should team up with fellow heroes Black Canary (Jurnee Smollett-Bell), Renee Montoya (Rosie Perez), and Huntress (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) to defeat Roman and finally bring an end to his reign of terror.With a noticeably more grounded approach to its source material, Birds of Prey is an exhausting but fun improvement over its predecessor in more ways than less, despite displaying some of the same issues. Unlike the preceding film, this one feels free from the confines of a PG-13 rating and ups the ante with its frequent use of strong violence and swearing. I can't help but feel that Suicide Squad would have been a better film had it taken this approach instead of playing it safe. By making Harley Quinn the sole main character, the film at least has one person to guide the audience through the story as opposed to multiple people each dealing with their own individual problems. With that said, the film attempts to implement Harley's anarchic mindset into its storytelling throughout the first and second acts, which proves problematic when trying to establish what her motivations are and why we should care at all. I do understand that Harley is supposed to be a mentally broken person with an unpredictable streak, but I felt that this did not gel well in the film's favour, as it only ends up making it seem more unsure of itself, overwhelming the viewer in the process. In spite of this, it is still nonetheless interesting to see inside the head of such an iconic character and watching how she deals with a breakup in her own unique ways.Director Cathy Yan continues Suicide Squad's style of brightly-coloured set pieces and a matching frenetic soundtrack to show off a more wild side to Gotham City we don't often get to see. This approach gives the film an almost music-video type feeling, especially with its song choices. For example, one scene features "Black Betty" as covered by the Australian hard rock band Spiderbait as Harley fights her way through multiple hired goons in a police station. It is highly likely that Margot Robbie, being an Aussie herself, chose this rendition of the song as it suits the scene better than the original. Moments like this show how Yan and Robbie must have gotten on so well during filming, especially since the latter is also credited as an executive producer.Even though Suicide Squad was poorly received by many, myself included, most will agree that Margot Robbie's performance as Harley Quinn was a major highlight (even earning praise from the character's co-creator Paul Dini) and the same can be said about this outing. There is plenty to enjoy in seeing Harley wreak havoc upon members of Gotham's crime syndicate with little care for the enemies she is making in the process. Robbie brings that much needed spark of madness to her character, constantly reminding the audience that she is still technically a villain in spite of her attempts at a good deed. In addition to this, Ewan McGregor is quite jarring to watch as the film's main antagonist, considering this is one of the rare times he has played a bad guy. Unfortunately, I feel that the remaining members of the titular Birds of Prey were somewhat underused, not leaving much of an impression until the final act. If a sequel is ever greenlit, hopefully they will be given more screen-time.In conclusion, while the film doesn't break too much new ground for the DC Extended Universe, fans of Harley Quinn and Robbie's performance should be greatly entertained. However, anyone who hated Suicide Squad will likely feel the same way about this film, as apart from the addition of graphic violence and profanity, there is not much else new worth recommending that would change their minds. While not quite a post-credits scene, there is a small amusing Easter egg that those who chose to stay back may smile at.I rate it 6.5/10






Birds of Prey: And the Fantabulous Emancipation of one Harley Quinn is a fantastic Warner Bros. DC R-rated movie since Suicide Squad, and Joaquin Phoenix's Joker. It's absolutely everything you ever wanted from Deadpool himself. It's funny, action packed, dazzling, massive thrill ride, and masterpiece, and colorful explosive DC Extravaganza! Margot Robbie has done it again as Harley Quinn! And Ewan McGregor is not so bad as the Black Mask, one of the best supervillain of Batman Universe. This reminds me of one of the best DC's #1 hit from DC Universe... Harley Quinn. And the story is kind of like the R-rated show. Now this is the R-rated film you wanted to see.






Good movie. Not the best in the dceu, but not bad. DC has been on the right track since Aquaman. I loved the very cartoonish feel the movie had. Never took itself too seriously. Lots of humor and a decent plot. Fun action scenes and the movie was very fast paced. The way the story is told is definitely inspired by Deadpool, which works in some cases, and doesn't in others. Liked the villains, especially Victor. Cool to seem him on the big screen. Liked how it left Joker out (though I'm a huge fan of him). Hate pop music but the pop heavy soundtrack was actually very good. Cool to see a movie with all those badass woman, but without the overly feminist feel. Overall a good movie but not amazing. The hyena could have been in the movie a bit more.






After an animated backstory of Dr. Harleen Quinzel's journey to becoming Harley Quinn (narrated by the film's star, Margot Robbie, who provides voice-over throughout the film), she breaks up with the Joker as only Harley can: Ace Chemicals go BOOM. Not having thought this through, Harley finds she has no shortage of scumbags gunning for her who were only held at bay by her connection with Mr. J.Meanwhile, there's a Gotham City crime lord called Roman Sionis/Black Mask (Ewan McGregor), who has a penchant for peeling faces off and is after a diamond that'll apparently help him seize control of the city. It eventually winds up in the hands (or rather stomach) of pickpocket, Cassandra Cain, who Harley finds herself wanting to help (for as long as it suits her, anyway).Also in the mix are a singer from Roman's nightclub (Dinah Lance/Black Canary), a cop (Renee Montoya) and a vigilante known as the 'Crossbow Killer' (aka Huntress). The first two get a decent amount of screentime and interact with Harley quite a bit, but unfortunately Mary Elizabeth Winstead's Helena Bertinelli feels underused and only really gets any time to shine towards the end of the film.The story is told in a non-linear fashion, which is something you'll either be fine with/able to follow or it will make you feel the film is 'all over the place'/'confusing'. It's actually not that hard if you pay attention. Could the story have been told in a 'simpler' fashion? Probably, but why should it? Other comic book films have played around with story structure, so why can't this one? And there's also nothing wrong with the film's soundtrack either.Margot Robbie's portrayal of Harley, like in Suicide Squad, continues to be the best part. She just brings so much energy and a real sense of 'fun' to the film, switching between a range of emotions, letting loose with her character's various quirks (her continued mission to enjoy an ever-elusive egg sandwich), taking delight in beating up bad guys (though resorting to non-lethal beanbag guns and glitter bombs when it comes to certain people) and adopting a pet hyena she calls Bruce (named after, according to Harley, "that hunky Wayne guy").Regarding the film's humour, it's no worse than 'bro humour' you get in films all the time, the only difference is this time it's female characters who are cursing/dishing out violence aplenty and enjoying themselves as they do so. No doubt this film will be put under unfair scrutiny, receive harsh judgement and all sorts of nitpicking from certain types of people (mostly those who were never going to give it a chance to begin with), but it isn't a movie for them. It's for those looking to go on an enjoyable fun ride.






Pretty generic action movie. Doesn't set itself apart from other recent action movies. Has some decent scenes, but doesn't bring anything new to the table unfortunately. Primary reason to watch this movie is margot.Little disappointed tbh.






An absolute riot from start to finish, Birds Of Prey is by far the best film in DC's Extended Universe, thrilling with delirious eccentricity and fun-loving action throughout. Bolstered by a dynamite lead cast, striking and energetic direction and gorgeous visuals, it's an enormously entertaining blockbuster.From its quirky, almost underdog-style action and humour to its immense energy, I was smiling and laughing all the way through Birds Of Prey. It's an enormous step in the right direction for DC, and feels light years away from the drab mess of Suicide Squad.It pops off the screen with a kaleidoscopic colour palette, flies along at rapid pace over the course of a fairly short runtime, and packs a great comedic punch with its fourth wall breaks, charismatic performances and self-aware sense of humour.The film definitely takes a lot of its cues from Deadpool, particuarly in its gleeful and still refreshing use of the freedom granted by its R rating. The action is spectacular and exciting, and with just enough violence to lend the movie genuine stakes - again a massive step up from the far more lifeless and sanitised Suicide Squad.Birds Of Prey is an anarchic, no-holds-barred comic book blockbuster through and through, and it has a heap of fun in that knowledge. With the exception of the names on the poster and the DC logo, this is barely a superhero movie, but more of an unadulterated action-crime extravaganza with a handful of thoroughly entertaining characters.The film's ensemble cast is absolutely brilliant from beginning to end. Although the screenplay gets a bit muddled as it attempts to establish five or six different main characters simultaneously, the performances are so dynamic and energetic that you're always eager to learn more about each character's story.Margot Robbie is dynamite as Harley Quinn, and leads the film with immense charisma - even more so than her standout turn in Suicide Squad.Alongside, Ella Jay Basco, Jurnee Smollett-Bell, Mary Elizabeth Winstead (whose appearance is rather brief) and especially Rosie Perez and Ewan McGregor bring delirious energy to the table, making Birds Of Prey more than just the fantabulous emancipation of one Harley Quinn, but a well-rounded and dynamic ensemble throughout.There's so much going on in this film that there's barely time to take a breath. While Suicide Squad attempted to use supposedly anarchic humour to mask an otherwise barebones plot, Birds Of Prey is filled to the brim with ideas, excitement and action, and director Cathy Yan brings it all together in spectacular fashion.Although there are a couple of occasions where the film gets a little muddled between introductions of all its characters, Yan gives Birds Of Prey such energy and life that whatever you're watching is an absolute delight. It doesn't all gel perfectly well as a consistent narrative, but every little side story is filled with more fun and eccentricity than the last.As a result, Birds Of Prey is an absolute blast no matter where you look. Its deliriously enjoyable visuals are backed up by an action-packed (albeit often muddled) plot, entertaining and likable characters, an eccentric and anarchic comedic vibe, big laughs throughout, a fantastic ensemble cast and directing that pulls it all together perfectly.






Perfectly executed IMAX thrill ride! A blast of exciting action, cinematography is beautiful, comedy is spot on, colors were so nice, and the stunts oh boy unbelievably well done. I'm so happy with the amount of character development involved a lot of movies don't heave enough of it Birds of Prey had plenty of letting the audience know as much info needed. I love the way everything plays out with so much style; very satisfying experience early into the year. Also my 790th review which is great!!






You going to feel stupid to pay for this movie. yes 80% of these characters are similar to the comics. you don't kill off a great villain again dc movies. all the time killing them off is just stupid. black mask would be perfect for a sequel in the gotham sirens. this movie plot was all over the place making no sense. men bashing constantly in this movie. I love high empowerment movies about women but dam it this is not how u do it. go watch wonder woman again instead of this trash. bvs looks better than this. ruin Cassandra cain origin from the comic book should've been an assassin not a child in this movie to act stupid. huntress was dimwitted idiot. black canary is ok. Harley is just being Harley enough said. dc you could do better than this. oh the zasz portrayel was a waste of space in this movie. omg idk what they tried to make joker 2.0 from ss. As a strong latin female you made Montoya stupid. how ruin her too. I give it a C- grade for this movie.
This low ratting is a bunch of bull. Because it's my favorite DC movie in awhile I love Black Mask crewing so much scenery he looks like he is about to eat the set and Harley as the narrator keeps the film from getting to dark. It does something feel like a Harley Quinn movie more than a Birds of Prey movie but they balance it out to be about 60 40






Great movie. Perfect action and fun and amazing Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn.






The story takes the time to develop each of its characters before putting them into a team, very much like the Avengers. Harley Quinn doesn't take up the whole film, time is actually used very well on each character. The exception to this is Huntress, who is seen only vaguely at the beginning of the film. I personally like how they characterized her, but that's just me. Black Mask is excellent, all the parts in the trailer of him being over the top are pretty much it, he is actually serious and intimidating but with a narcissistic edge, not at all like the joker or any other DCEU villain. The story is told from in fractured time from Harley's perspective wich is either a good or a bad thing depending on your opinion of her accent. The special effects are better than in past films and also very sparingly used. at the moment it is only minuets after seeing the movie i only have one real problem with the movie, wich isn't even really a problem with the film itself and is more of a personal grievance.
Overall, fun enjoyable film.






Well, it was certainly an... interesting movie, and Margot Robbie gets her bragging rights as the co-producer/possible co-screenwriter/principal star of not only a movie, but the first in what ought to become a new franchise within the DCEU. However, it does not achieve even the level of passable entertainment. Robbie chews the scenery and locks her face onto the camera at all times, the rest of the "Birds of Prey" are just accessories, Ewan MacGregor is not only useless, but quite literally directionless, as he shouts some of his outbursts with THREE different accents competing one against another, and the rest of the male cast are idiots and dweebs. Since this was made on an under-$100 Million budget, it is going to score a nice profit, and its critical reception is going to give the guys at Warner and DC some confidence in the viability of the DCEU, but this is nothing to crow about.
I'm happy to report that Birds of Prey: And the Fantabulous Emancipation of Harley Quinn is an effing Awesome DC movie ! It's more as the movie over than Suicide Squad (way better), and Margot Robbie was totally born to play Harley Quinn this makes her becoming a Powerhouse actress.Without Robbie, Harley and the movie wouldn't work at all. Not just it's a solid Harley Quinn movie, this also blended into the origin story of Birds of Prey's women that so perfectly well done. All I can says is that I want 10 more of Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn movies and the BOP's women stand-alone movie for sure. The most genius point of the movie is this had Rashomon's storytelling style and the action-sequences are in the same style with John Wick and Atomic Blonde that will pleasing the audiences a lot ! This movie will gives a lot of opportunities to Cathy Yan to do a lot of great female-action movies in the future, and it's satisfying breakthrough for her as well. Great cast with Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Rosie Perez, Jurnee Smollett-Bell are fantastic and Ewan McGregor's best role since Obiwan Kenobi. Great soundtrack too, and it's a much better female empowerment movie than 2019's Charlie's Angels that also a big middle finger to Elizabeth Banks too, basically, it's the best #MeToo movie we got so far.It's a must for DC's hardcore fans and female's audiences, Recommended this in IMAX.






This movie has sadly been a major disappointment for me.
The pros:
Margot Robbie makes the best out of bad writing and manages to portray a crazy and funny Harley Quinn.
The Cons:
The action scenes literally feel like playing the tutorial of a video game with a level 100 character.
"Emanzipation" in this Movie literally means that every male character is an complete idiot and/or an a**hole while every female character is the most badass person ever.
The plot is a cliché, the first 30ish minuets set up the story and the rest of the plot is 100% predictable and does not surprise even once.
Ewan McGregor is completely wasted as Black Mask, he is literally a laughing stock and even a 12 year old is more badass than him.
The music and visuals are mediocre at best.






It's a completely offbeat story and seems to have no major connection to any upcoming DC movie. Margot Robbie is a wonderful Harley Quinn. It's magic, how she pulls it off. I've been following tv series, Arrow, The Flash etc. and the characters in this movie seem to be missing the flair the tv series characters have. Sometimes dry, sometimes boring, sometimes energetic and exiting. Respectfully, this movie is a big screen go or a no-go. I already felt from the trailer that this might be a movie that I would not want to recommend. I went for the respect for DC.
Peace Out!






First.. got to say that I didn't know much of the back story, but the trailer looked interesting so what the heck. I am a fan of action movies, super hero movies, and villain movies.. but apparently you had to really REALLY know the whole background of this movie to enjoy it. It definitely had some good parts, but man, this think (in terms of violence) made Black Hawk Down seem like a G-rated Disney movie. Honestly.. it was "violence overload"!
By the way.. stay stay stay to the very very last credit to find out....Review from Dan Slentz of "Reel Tunez.. The Radio Show All About The Movies"






Don't get me wrong, Margot Robbie plays great as Harley Queen and there are moments of fun in the movie but overall something about girls kicking ass big guys with guns was not very interesting nor very fun to see. Poor action quality for a movie that does not intend to be Sci-Fi.
I am fully aware that I am in the minority of people that have really enjoyed all of the DCEU movies, even Suicide Squad. That meant that I was optimistic going into Birds of Prey, but it still managed to exceed my expectations.First of all, Margot Robbie is fantastic as Harley Quinn. She was easily the best part of Suicide Squad, and I loved every second she was on screen in this film. Ewan McGregor was also great as Black Mask, and the rest of the cast fit into their roles well. It wasn't as much of a team film as the trailers and the title might have led you to believe, but it worked for me. Birds of Prey is definitely a Harley Quinn centred story, with her and the rest of the characters coming together towards the end.Above everything else, this was an extremely fun movie, with plenty of over-the-top action, witty dialogue, fun characters, and a storyline that was engaging to watch. It didn't have a particularly deep plot, and I don't think they took the villain as far enough as they perhaps should have, but it was definitely serviceable and I didn't mind too much because of how well they executed everything else.The colour pallet was also a lot darker than I expected. I could have understood this choice if they were going for a tone similar to Suicide Squad, but this was a lot more fun than that film and I would have liked the shots to be a little brighter.Overall, Birds of Prey is yet another win for the DCEU, and I can see myself watching it again in the very near future.SCORE: 83%






With some great, all out performances, and a sheer sense of fun energy; Birds of Prey makes for an entertaining comic book film that may not be totally original, but is certainly different from the rest. The film's script can be a bit average at times, containing plot points you have certainly seen before, however, where Birds of Prey shines most is its unique sense of storytelling and the ridiculously entertaining things it does with it. Margot Robbie give a 'fabulous' performance as Harley Quinn, removing all my doubts of her playing the famous character after Suicide Squad. The other women in the film also give some great performances, with the greatest stand out being Mary Elizabeth Winstead who steals every ounce of her screen time, bringing her A-game as always. Ewan McGregor also gives a fun filled performance as the film's titular villain Black Mask. The film is filled with absolutely awesome action sequences that are bound to at least put a grin on your face, and if that doesn't, then the large dose of well-timed humor will certainly do the trick. In the end, Birds of Prey isn't the best DC has had to offer, but it is certainly a blast, and certainly an experience unlike any other.
My Rating: 9.25/10






Despite major criticisms towards Suicide Squad, it seems that DC wouldn't just let it be a mistake to leave behind and be embarrased by. They chose to keep a lot of the same elements (most of which were the ones highly enjoyed in SS) and elevate them and turn them into this crazy carnival ride, where Harley Quinn will find herself and gather a team next to her.
And despite many people's worries, I think the movie does a great job of seperating the Birds of Prey from Harley. Make no mistake, this is obviously a Harley Quinn movie. But by the end, you'll see just how she managed to make something that will be able to stand on its own which is just amazing. Let's face it, that just wouldn't have happened on the big screeen in the next ten years without the help from the iconic Harley Quinn (movie) character. They could totally do a spin-off alone with the Birds now - or maybe still keep Harley in a smaller role (Gotham City Sirens leading up to?).In the end, I think the movie succeeded in exactly what it wanted to be. It wanted to be a trip. It wanted to be a Harley Quinn origin story. It wanted to be a Birds of Prey origin story. It wanted to be a story about finding yourself after losing your identity (relationship, job, safety, vengeance road). Incorporating all of that means chaos...but that is the point of this Harley Quinn's character exactly. The movie is through her mind. And you just have to stick along and enjoy the chaos unfold in a delightful and sharp manner and explosion of colors... and other stuff.Note: I've heard several complaints about this Harley Quinn character being so different or not as good as the comic book ones or the one(s) in the animated show(s), sidecharacters not being treated with respect etc.... Honestly, people, just because this is a movie and it's given a big budget, it's still just a singular version of the character(s). Like in any other platform. Why should it try to copy (which, it still does borrow a lot and pay homage several places)? You wouldn't say that if this was a new comic book series with Harley and the Birds of Prey, would you now. Anywhere you start new, you start new. You don't just copy. (*cough cough* Lion King remake *cough* I mean live action version.) Enjoy every version for themselves please, I'm sure they all have good sides and bad sides you can take something from, and the approach here is clearly working for what DC has been wanting to do with their cinematic universe. Which IMO we all are being way too hard on. You don't see the same kinda pressure with the often formularic Marvel movies (with all the respect to them and what they are trying to do), so it should only be fair to show some respect and mercy where more creativity and risks are the things being prioritized. Right? This is just one version, not more and not less credit to it than any other version - just more people will probably see it because it's the mainstream one. And this cinemac universe will keep expanding in all layers. Remember to have fun. The movie is very inviting of that.






Birds of Prey definitely a must-see! It gives a more detailed, and interesting take on Harley Quinn, compared to her character in Suicide Squad. Preformances were spectacular, but I have one complaint. Huntress was not as developed as I would've hoped. Overall, this was a great film, and I suggest you go see it!






Movie has a problem with identity, very bad choose of a director, good action with bad directing, too much heroes that dont do anything for the story (huntress especially)






The film has it's flaws, but don't give it 1 stars just because it has a diverse cast or because it's DC. The flaws in this superhero have been the exact same flaws in other MCU or DC movies. Stop being salty or stop hating cause its not Marvel (only generalizing)






The movie was watchable and funny at 1 or 2 moments but to be honest, it's one of the films which is forgettable. Most of the jokes were cringe and narration felt so weak. The characterisation was awful(except Robbie and McGregor, they were good, others were meh). They wasted Black Mask, the climax was disappointing. It's better than suicide squad, that's an improvement. I don't know about how others felt but for me, it was a below average film.
Overall, the movie is great fun, with awesome action scenes and a kicking soundtrack. If you're looking flirt the cartoon Harley Quinn don't bother. These characters are real women warts and all, and I adore them for it.The script is a bit simplistic, Rosie Perez's Detective Montoya doesn't quite work as planed, and Mary Elizabeth Winstead comes across a little too soft as Huntress but these flaws are balanced by Margot Robbie who is still pitch perfect as Harley and Jurnee Smollett-Bell who is freaking awesome as Black Canary and Ewan McGregor's delightfully twisted Roman Sionis






This movie was entertaining and fun. Similar to how the Joker movie is it's own stand alone take on the character this movie is a fun standalone movie where it doesnt need to fit into any other DC movie tropes. It also definitely reminded me of the more recent standalone Harley Quinn comics. The plot is more loose and fun with Harley going off on her own adventures finding herself without the Joker. I could see how some people may not like the new Harley but I think it keeps well within the spirit of her character.






Take your favorite movie, ok now take away the plot, any scenery, and all the props. Ok so now it's a couple of actors standing in a room. Now take away the actors. Just a room now. So now we're going to put a snail at one end of the room and watch it go to the other side of the room for two hours. That movie is still a million times better than this movie.






I loved Birds of Prey. It is Fantabulous 😊 It is brash, colourful, violent, silly, comic, and at the same time has pathos and is emancipating. Those women kick some serious arse! The music is fantastic. Let the whole thing wash over you and emerge grinning into the light. 10/10!






Such an awesome movie! I always walk into a DCEU movie with a dash of hesitation, but this... this was awesome!!! The cast hits every character perfectly and the action is AMAZING! Absolutely worth seeing in theaters!






All I'm going to say is this movie was FRICKIN' FANTASTIC!! And you should go see it. Now. That's all puddin' xx ;)






In the movie, every man is depicted and a murderer, rapists or incompetent moron. Harley seems to be an immoral, taking on an entire building full of cops and a dozen escaped criminals with just a bat an a attitude. No one has a gun apparently in Gotham City. Wish i could get my money and 2 hours back.






I get that it's a comic book movie, but this is in the vein of Batman forever, and nobody wanted that. Could have been so much more if it was just a little serious.






There has to be a subject, but how could it be so bad and simple? There are events, but the goal is too weak! Flashback or something boring. Recurring events constantly. Harley's fight with 5-6 professional killers and Harley knocking it all was a great example of feminist. What did you need to add "R-Rated"? Deficiencies such as easy spending of some characters, insufficient scores, and action shots were noticeable. Cinematography is fine compared to a comic book movie! Acting performance is good. Other than that, it is a comic book movie that will not be forgotten over time.⭐ 100/57






It was so good I clapped at the end it's different funny the style of it is amazing so much better than suicide squad






Much like Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool, Margot Robbie was born to play Harley Quinn. Excellent performance as the character.Great soundtrack too and decent action, although very unrealistic, it's ok.A good hero needs a stronger villain than them, to overcome. Sadly, the writer fails here. Ewan plays the part very well, but the character itself is weak. Mid level criminal and It takes all the Birds of Prey to overcome him and his goons for hire. Ruined the guts of the movie.Huntress is the only other bird of prey with substance. The rest are pointless or perhaps just badly constructed. Pointless really.This really should have been just a Harley Quinn film with assistance from a bird of prey or two. With a bad guy on the level or the joker.I was expecting a man hating movie or women are better than men theme. It had me in the bench on wether to see it or not. Thankfully theres only a couple of digs at white people and men. Glad I went to see it, but I wouldn't go again.
I really enjoyed the movie I laughed and everything and I am not a fan of action movies or DC even but this movie yea sure it isn't perfect but so far it's one of the best movies of 2020 the thing that made me mad is that 90% of the guys in the movie are evil






Margot Robbie as Harley is genius casting and all of the performances in this are pretty good.
The action is fun, exciting, and at times pretty violent.
However. The story is all over the place and even kinda messy at times. Even tho I enjoyed Harley Quinn and Black Canary in this. I feel like they should of done more with the other characters. Overall I was pretty disappointed with Black Mask, and I wanted a lot more Huntress. Its not bad, but it could of been better. 6/10






This is everything you'd expect from a Harley Quinn movie, and if you go into it just looking for a good time you probably will enjoy it. It's a loud, manic, colourful, and vulgar in your face film and that is exactly what it should be. I genuinely laughed out loud numerous times and there are some great fight scenes in this. Don't let the trolls make your mind up for you. If you think you might enjoy this film chances are you will.






I liked the movie because it was creative, the story was told in different ways. We start we comics. Harley acts as the narrator and tells us the story, sometimes going back. There are a few funny dialogs and scenes. We see a development of character as Harley is single now and must learn to be on her own. The Birds of Prey, Harley and Cass are a strong, diverse group of women. There is a lot of diversity in the whole movie. The fact that it was written and directed by women also made me curious. Margot Robbie as Harleen Quinzel / Harley Quinn is especially incredible if you consider that she's Australian playing a crazy psychiatrist with a thick American accent. Ewan McGregor was convincing as a bad guy, especially in one scene. Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Huntress, Jurnee Smollett-Bell as Black Canary, Rosie Perez as Montoya, Chris Messina as Zsasz, Ella Jay Basco as Cass were also good. The music helped frame the shots as well. Go check out the movie yourself.






This film started with pleasantly aesthetic story of harley quinn..It turns out to be pitiful as the story dragging too much.Yes,Margot Robbie and Ewan Mcgregor steal the show.Otherwise,the supporting talent wasted with bland acting.The joke was not on point and get cringey sometimes except for Margot Robbie.However,the cinematography is beautifully shot.This movie pack of action and extraordinary fighting scene tooOverall,this film is worth-watching for adult and not suitable for kids






It is an interesting movie, great action scenes that contain very beautiful music, and making the movie was the greatest






Better than captain marvel, i love it and dont listen people who gives this a bad score bcoz there are many DC haters






Would give it a 7 or maybe 6, but I'm just compensating for all the 1's with no reason at all.






It's amazing margot robbie is really good in this and you should defendly see this






It's definitely Breath of Fresh Air in Comic World and now DC know the resipe of success. It's a DC Girl Gang Bashing heads and nut all over the place the only thing I personally miss is Poison Ivy but maybe in Sequel..but definitely acting is fantabulous by every member of the cast.. It's Surprisingly Good Really Good






It's amazing really great í think you should see this movie






Beware of positive reviews that refer to films they rate highly as 'uneven'. It's critic speak for when what little appeal the flick they're shilling, may have had, drops away into some infinitely deep hole of 'no quality lives down here'.
There's around 10 minutes, total, of near fun in this whole picture. That is all.
To the producers of this farce, and to wary would be viewers, I have this to say : Read. The. Books. And. Respect. The. Source.






Too many fight scenes, the main villain was kinda underdeveloped, and it all felt very cliché too. It was really that funny either and there wasn't a lot of chemistry between Harley and the other 'Birds of Prey'. Still, some of the fight seems were entertaining and I did actually enjoy Harley's hectic (but also kinda hard to follow) storytelling at the start. But since the entire movie was pretty much focused Harley, there wasn't enough screen time for the other protagonists, so it didn't make sense being called Birds of Prey.






The movie is good. Plot is ok-ish but the action is amazing, Margot Robbie is amazing and so is Ewan McGregor and Rosie Perez. It's a good movie. A good one-time watch






This movie is a complete joy ride from beginning to end. It never stops with full packed action scenes, comedy moments and it takes advantage of the R rated version in order to deliver some truly shocking and unique moments.Margot Robbie totally shines in this film and Ewan McGregor delivers one of the most wickedly fun and sinister villains in comic book films.Totally worth watching. Please judge by yourself as most people in the comments are given bad ratings based on misguided notions of the film based on an all female leading cast.






Birds Of Prey is the movie that shouldn't be named birds of prey this is basically Harley Quinn movie and origin for Birds of Prey ( Renne Montoya , Huntress , Black Canary) . Overall movie is full to watch simple story.Talking about characters Harley Quinn played by Margot Robbie is best thing in the movie, she is fabulous and has good scenes. Black Canary, Huntress were good too , would love to watch more by them.I hated Renne Montoya character from the beginning i didn't enjoyed watching her I was basically ignoring her in movie / ending.Black Mask - I loved Ewan as Sionis but they killed him !!!???? Big F ? Why would you do that killing Sionis was bad choice. Sionis in movie is weird not like in comics but i loved him.Action scenes are good , fun to watch.
Brilliant, creative, fun, and kickass - amazing way to introduce and incorporate complex characters from comics. Take all your milquetoast characters that've been redone a million times and shove 'em!






Though Margot Robbie is a talented actress and portrays Harley Quinn very well, the plot and character arcs in this movie all fall flat. The intro is quirky, funny, and seems promising but never truly rises at any point during the movie. The narration bit wasn't confusing, but didn't do anything to help drive the boring plot home. Add that to the fact that there was no real struggle or villain ...I mean...come on, you own the city but apparently no guns? Which leads me to my next point. Ewan McGregor. Fantastic actor, terrible role. I hold this opinion for almost all the characters in the movie. None of their character arcs are meaningful or develop enough for us to care about them. Another issue I had with the movie is the failed attempts at action choreography. I mean, you have dudes standing around and falling back before they're even hit...Honestly. It was a great concept. It just failed to take flight.
This movie was so much fun. Of course it had its flaws but it so was entertaining. The fight sequences were all well done, and the acting was all good. Trolls most likely don't like it cause it's a very open movie. It low key had a political stance and is very much about woman empowerment, but i had a good time the whole movie and I'm a guy lol just sit back and enjoy!!






They have earned billions from this crazed superhero era but they want more.
as long as those movies make money they will use each character no matter if he/she is not popular like the main lead superhero characters like....(batman, superman, spiderman and the rest)
so after like....7 batman movies, the joker movie let's take your money they said with a minor character from the batman universe named.....Harley quin.
what's really the point ?
when this is going to stop...?
let's see now.....we have also a certain...PENGUIN from the batman universe,,,let's make a solo movie for him too......we also have batman's...BUTLER let's do another movie for him too....etc...etc
they say this movie flopped with only like....30 plus millions O.W in America.
they anticipated much more...still this is a lot of money if u consider this is about....Harley........HARLEY WHO ?
AHHH...don't bother ...it's superhero = it will make money.
what a waste of time INDEED.Simply don't bother with this crap.






I saw this movie today. I haven't read the comics so can't make a comparison. I'm just your average movie goer, not a troll.
I like Margot Robbie and I know she was heavily involved in this movie. It's a shame, because it's not very good. Most of the humour didn't hit the mark. We are asked to believe that a supposedly highly intelligent person becomes a kookie super hero/villain because she broke up with her boyfriend. So of course when one goes out on their own they buy a hyena for company! One minute she's ditsy, the next she is making a profound psychiatric diagnosis. Ding-a-ling-a-ling!
The baddie Roman was a cutout villain with no depth & no back story about how he ended up a villain. He was like a child who lost his favourite toy & having a tantrum.
There's a song & dance routine thrown into the mix when Harley nearly got knocked out that was superfluous, making no sense.
Some of the fight scenes were fun when the humour hits the mark, but for the most part this movie is just silly. Not fantastic, not terrible, just silly.






The funny one liners,stunts, and the character of Harley Quinn totally made this movie good. It was fun,and better than Suicide Squad in my opinion.






I went to the movie to see the world of maniac, the psychology of Harley Quinn and Dr. Harleen Frances Quinzel inside the madness and crime of Gotham City.But what we got? The same tragody like Suicide Quad.Great music only is not helping to make 0 8 15 fight scenes
spectacular!
And it feels like the whole movie was made only because of the 0 8 15 fight scenes.To see Gotham City in the movie was like to watch the movie Hairspray.Margot has driven the Harley. So far so good.Ewan is a good actor but as Black Mask? In the movie he feels like a wanna be Joker not like a mastermind of crime and torture.Best part was the amusement park scene. A realy good atmosphere, a Gotham City atmosphere.
Unfortunately destroyed by the 0 8 15 fight scenes.






The plot is okay,ewan mcgregor and margot robbie gave great performaces but its a mess.Its all over the place.
Atleast it has some nice special effects and the fight scenes were kinda cool.






It may seem risky but at least it is something new. The whole movie is entertaining to watch and with that you easily forgot noticing Margot performances, which is very amazing. This film deserves more acknowledgment.






DC's Movie Always Awesome.. I Hope Everey One Enjoy It






Really a great movie, Margot Robbie's performance was excellent.






Colorful, fun, violent, entertaining, funny, and a little gore? I really enjoyed this film. I'm a Harley Quinn fan and an even bigger Margot Robbie fan and she was truly the perfect person for this role. I enjoyed the new characters a lot. I thought the film kind of jumped around but it wasn't bad jumping around. I think the "all over the place"-ness of the movie reminded me of Harley Quinn herself and it set a good tone for the movie.






With last years Joker and this years Harley, DC finally seems to be slowly getting their S*** together! I'm not saying this film was perfect by any means but the way this movie was produced and shot was incredible. The pacing was a bit slow with the 3rd act feeling a bit too quick. This film has got to be 10x better than Suicide Squad and perfectly places Margot Robbie's performance as Harley Quinn atop one of the greats in movie villain history. Go give it a watch and enjoy the awesome colors and fun visuals this movie has to offer.






Very Good for What It Is. Kept My Attention The Whole Time. A Great group of Ladies in the Cast. Ewan Mcgregor was a Casualty for Me in This. Just Couldn't Get into Him as a Bad Guy. Margot Robbie Shines as Harley. Steals Every Scene She is In. They Just Didn't Take Advantage of the R Rating in This I Feel. Could Have had More Gore in The Action Scenes to be Honest. I Like That. But Bottom Line Good Movie.






Comic lovers are usually fanatics. They try their imagination to be in the movie and it is not always possible for many reasons.
I read lots of comic. Some of them become complete different movies. Both were acceptable aside for the differences.
Margo Robbie comes back as Harley Quinn, Jokers girlfriend; but spite the familiarity and relation of these characters do not expect social / psychological drama like JOKER. This is a dark comedy!!!. Yes there are some embedded messages about "machismo" and all men are betrayers (in fact every men in the movie betrays somebody and the main bad guy is gay. Women on the other side, help each other unconditionally.
The story is a back and forth mess mixed with cartoons, inserted graphics and Harley talking to the audience; everything looking for a comic effect that mostly succeed.
At the end is basically a satire about comic and superheroes (or supervillains) loaded with almost non stop burst of absurd and/or strong violence, mostly bloodless and absolutely sexless (violence good sex bad, Hollywood culture).
The movie is kinetic enough to keep your attention.
Robbie and Ewan McGregor (as the apparently gay villain) deliver performances switching from scary to comedy or drama with incredible ease. Perhaps are no Oscar worthy but are quite solid.
Jurnee Smollett-Bell does a very good physical character. I believe is somebody to follow.
Rosie Perez looks lost and no happy. I do not understand why. Mary Elizabeth Winstead has a few comic moments but her character is very underwritten. Rest of the characters are mostly stunt doubles.It is important to mention that there is a substantial stunt work making even the most absurd scenes believable. It is fresh air over Disney mostly digitally animated Marvel sagas.In brief; not Oscar worthy but plenty of fun






Action was really good. Little comedy worked fine..






The Joker(Leto, not Phoenix) kicks out Harley(Robbie, showing more sides and dimension), in just the most recent of many cases of her trying to please guys who clearly aren't good for her. As such she no longer has his protection, and as it turns out a lot of people have grievances with her. They are frequently introduced in freeze-frame gags that are one of the numerous ways in which this is Suicide Squad if that movie was actually great, and not a mess, editing and tone wise. Other examples include the extensive use of music, which here is allowed to land and be effective, instead of almost immediately ending. As well as the story structure not being quite chronological in showing the events, now properly setting up who the different people are, and giving them depth. Black Canary(Smollett-Bell, an incredible performer, you seriously have to hear her cover of "This Is A Man's World" for yourself) sings in the club of Roman Sionis(McGregor, deliciously unpredictable as a cruel narcissist), but if pressed, she might be willing to admit that he does awful things. Renee Montoya(Perez) is an excellent cop who struggles to because of rotten coworkers. She believes that Huntress(Elizabeth Winstead, cool while also a hilarious Batman parody) is working for him, just like Victor Zsasz(Messina, sadistic, understands his master and knows how to deal with his outbursts) his right-hand man. Teenager Cassandra Cain just robbed him, not realising it would put a bullseye on her back. So the four women(who feel like they're each in their own film... and it's so good. Just. The very best) have to try to protect her, as every criminal in Gotham City tries to score by catching her.This movie deeply resonates with a lot of people. The feeling of being rejected and not giving up. Of standing up for what's right, even if you feel like you don't have a personal stake in the matter. It is easy to relate to the young pickpocket, and want to see her safe. Second unit director Chad Stahelski, known for helming the three John Wick chapters, lends the action scenes the same fluidity here, again highlighting the significant fighting prowess of the combatants, and, here, also the teamwork on display. Despite similarities, this doesn't feel like it's just Deadpool starring Quinn. It has its own distinct identity. In some ways it's equal or superior to those two pictures. This choice makes a ton of sense for this.There is a lot(not an excessive amount) of gore, violence and strong language in this. I wholeheartedly recommend this to everyone that the promotional material appeals to. 8/10






The DC world is suppose to be dark, violent and crazy and after trying to compete with Marvel's family universe - they are now going down the right track and where they should of gone. I am big Batman the animated series fan - and this Harley Quinn just reminded of the Harley Quinn in it. Margot Robbie plays the role so well - and writers and done a super job. It has the right amount of humour, action, darkness and also craziness with the dash of Harley Quinn colour. The movie it's self plot wise was great - nothing complicated. I was expecting a disaster- but received a very enjoyable couple of hours. It just makes me so angry on how bad they messed up the Suicide Squad!






This movie has its issues as all do. But it has really good moments as well. It follows the lives of all these "birds" and how they have been "preyed on by society". That is what this movie is going for and it does a good job of it. This is a legitimate girl super hero movie and follows such as its script.What is the most heroic thing a girl in society can do?Break out of chains and doing what they believe in! People like Rosa Parks, Harriet Tubman they all follow these kinds of acts. Overcoming horrific things and coming out at the other endThink of this movie as a hyperbolic Female Super Hero movie and you'll enjoy it7/10






Most movies have that one thing that all critics mention in their review of the movie and for this one, I have a good feeling that it's going to be the action sequences because they were on par with John Wick. I honestly can't say I've seen action sequences this well-done since John Wick in recent years. Every single action scene is well thought out on how it's all going to go down and how to keep everything in frame and use as little edits as possible. There are so many great action sequences that just show off how badass all of these women are. The women wouldn't be badass if they had weak actresses playing them and this movie does not have them. Everybody in this movie was outstanding in the acting department with some being obvious and others not so. The main stand out to me was Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn. In Suicide Squad she was one of the good elements in that movie and she just further proves it in this movie. She helps bring a majority of the comedy and nails it so well. At this point, I think everybody who reads my reviews knows that Ewan McGregor is one of my favourite actors and he still kills it as Roman in this movie. I will admit at certain times he does go a little bit over the top but for a majority of the time, he's a great villain. I will say that the beginning of the movie is slow because they have to introduce everybody but once it picks up the pace it picks it up fast. I have to applaud the set design people because the sets in this movie were outstanding. The last thing I want to mention is the score, composed by Daniel Pemberton, that I could see myself listening to and jamming out to. In the end, I got sucked into the story of Birds of Prey and this movie is definitely worth checking out. I give Birds of Prey a 8.5/10.






Introduced in the much-maligned Suicide Squad back in 2016, Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn was easily one of the most likeable aspects of the film, so it makes sense that she gets her own film in the DCEU, Robbie herself serving as producer for the project. Ever since the hot-mess that was Justice League, Warner Bros. have learnt their lesson and have given us some light and fun superhero films but can they keep that trend going with Birds of Prey?Free from her relationship with the Joker, Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) sets about living her best life for herself. With knowledge that she is no longer with the Clown Prince of Crime, it's not long before she finds herself a target for those she has wronged, including crime lord Roman Sionis/Black Mask (Ewan McGregor).Make no mistake, despite the title being Birds of Prey, this is very much a Harley Quinn film, with the titular team not coming together until the final act. It's a film based around the idea of Quinn being free from the hold of the Joker and finding herself in a city full of deadbeats and whackjobs, yet it never feels as if they're trying to shove any messages down your throat. Christina Hodson's writing may not be the greatest but it does serve up a lot of fun dialogue and sequences that Cathy Yan directs quite wonderfully.Yan reached out to Chad Stahelski, the director of the John Wick franchise, to help choreograph the action sequences and the results are simply stunning. They let loose with the craziness for sure in all of the sequences, violence and wide shots aplenty as we get to comprehend what is happening, a trend I'd love to see continue in action films these days.Serving as a producer for the film means Margot Robbie works hard both in front of and behind the camera, her performance in Birds of Prey completely embodying the chaotic nature of Harley Quinn. It's one of those performances where you can just tell the actor loves playing the role and that feeling is infectious to the audience watching her. Being a female-centric superhero film means Robbie is joined by the likes of Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Jurnee Smollett-Bell and Rosie Perez, all serving as fierce independent characters that can mix-it with the scum of Gotham. Winstead and Smollett-Bell are definitely two I'd like to see more of in future films. Ewan McGregor plays the main villain of the piece and he's clearly having a ball too, bringing out both the flamboyant and psychotic nature of the character very well.Birds of Prey manages to keep the momentum going for the DCEU, joining both Aquaman and Shazam! in being an absolute blast that focuses on having fun rather than moping around in doom and gloom. I'd certainly love to see more of Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn and with her wanting to bring the Gotham City Sirens to the big screen, I think it'd be a mistake by Warner Bros. to not make that come true.






Margot Robbie for the win! The fight choreography was extremely well done.






I have no clue where all the heat is coming from regarding this movie it was so much fun I will see you at five more times! This was DC's version of Deadpool it was so fun!!






If you disliked the long character introductions in Suicide Squad then this will irk you just as well since much of the beginning is plagued by constant backtracking for character expositions. Eventually things pick up, with some awesome fight scenes for the violence we all came for. But then the slog continues as most of the characters are just plain uninteresting. Roman, Canary, Zsasz, Cassandra - all bring little to the table and aren't enticing when being the main focus.Humor is all over the place, ranging from well-placed to "let's just have Harley say something here to show quirkiness" which can be off-putting or cringey.Personally, I'm not a fan of kid characters in adult movies. They show things down with constant babysitting, get in the way of potentially great moments, and are just overall unnecessary characters. This and Deadpool 2 are no different, and Cassandra could've be written out. This would have been better themed with Harley trying to pull off a big heist to show off her independent chops instead of the tiresome "become a foster mother to this woeful child" trope.






All female this Birds of Prey: obviously the five actresses who embody the story, of which the main Margot Robbie, is also a producer; screenwriter Christina Hodson and director Cathy Yan.
In line with the #Me Too, the protagonist boys are all big cocks and will all end badly. Comic book like never before, it could not be otherwise, we are in the DC Comics area, it can also have fun, even if the fighting scenes are often repetitive and tiring even for the most benevolent spectators to indulge the insulsaggini, supported by a smashing acoustic created for rooms with Dolby Atmos. But there is no going further. Where the previous story "Suicide Squad" had more narrative and stylistic consistency.
We should expect a continuation if the response to the world box office is adequate. That's all!






This movie is very good I like it and I like Harley queen oh my God
Disgusting feminist message that made me want to puke






Didn't care too much about psychedelic nature of it all along with all the flashbacks to the point certain scenes were shown twice. From watching the trailers it gave that kind of vibe but it was just too much. It was funny in some parts but overall it was nothing special especially in comparison to these raving critic reviews. It was an okay one time watch. One bright spot was Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Huntress. Would like to see more of her in future movies or even her own movie






I think that people need to actually go see this film, instead of forming reviews before watching it.






Sure, it may not be strictly true to the comic books. Sure, it may not be a film that appeases a mans idea of a superhero/anti-hero/villain movie, but what this film has is a subtlety that all other female DC films lack. It's about women and female empowerment without forcing it down your throat. It doesn't mansplain feminism. It's cool and entertaining just because. The action scenes are amazing. It's humorous, and bloody and coming back to what DC are good at. Long gone are the days of them trying to balance PG family friendliness with grit (aka suicide squad and the entire batman v superman franchise). This film is straight up great-time gold. If you don't take it so seriously with so much emphasis on it being true to scripture then it will not disappoint. Let's all chill out a bit hey?






Very disappointed, they story line sucked, the Black Canary only uses her Canary cry once throughout the whole movie!! They are supposed to be villains and they come off as heroes.. Soooo Very Disappointed Don't Waist Your Time, Wait until It Hit Redbox or On Netflix.
A lot of people saying that this movie is not important in dceu at now. But this movie is a bumper and rock like a superhero movie. some cast look sucks but still acting, madness and worthyness make this movie one of best. This genere of superhero movies are really new. And harley quinn and margarot robbie gonna superstar and more popular day by day.






Okay so before i start this review i absolutely loved Suicide Squad seeing as everyone keeps hating on it & Birds Of Prey is not even comparable to suicide Squad.Right so i was really looking forward to this film as another Harley film was due, before i rip into the film i will say That Margot Robbie did do a good job of portraying Harley again, she definitely fell into character & hope she continues with the role in the future.Now i am a DC lover & preference DC over Marvel so before anyone downvotes this because its a typical "bash DC" type review.Following from the great acting by Margot only, all the other characters in the film have barley any back story & just tagged along to satisfy the plot, which was very generic of some bad guy gets angry & wants to kill the main character but in this case the bad guy wants to kill all of the girls because they have all done something to annoy him. Its almost like one of those films where each person has a mini part to the film then they all come together in the end but for different reasons. How many times have we seen that, i don't know what i was expecting going into this film but it just felt like another film to copy Marvel in a way, like she recruited people kinda way. I didn't connect with the girls or the villain because i didn't care about them like i do with other characters in other films, i felt like that was the problem, they didn't show enough to do with them, its just a mindless film, just look at the Joker for character feel, you can feel what he was going through & how he was coping, thats the connection the film needed with Harley alone, not with anyone else.The villain is your usual bad guy within the film, he has money, power an can do what he wants & because a load of girls have annoyed him he wants to kill them & thats the entire film. But as a villain he wasn't really effective, he just did a lot of talking & got his henchmen men to do the work & by the end of the film its the usual scenario of bad team of 100+ people vs a few people & you know who i going to win.I feel like the film could of been made in 3 ways, the way it is now being one usual recruit people type of film, the 2nd being like the Joker was, as in more about Harley, focusing on her & what she is going through after breaking up with the Joker & her getting back on her feet & doing crazy things Or the 3rd way which could of been Harley getting back at the Joker in various ways.In terms of a girl empowerment film or anything like that i have no comment as it doesn't bother me who is who & what is what.Overall we (Our film group of 4) were not amazed or going "Awe" or "WooW" throughout the film, it just didn't connect or make you feel any emotion for the film.Hopefully Wonder Women will be epic as i loved the first WW film.Age - 25

Watch, Avoid, Consider: Do watch as its a DC film but don't expect much, your come away disappointed.
First of ignore all the men who seem to be ignorant to the fact an all female action movie has happened, I as a man who doesn't have his head up his you know what.. can guarantee half the negative reviews here are from people who haven't seen it and are just hating for no reason.Speaking as DC lover this movie gave me everything I needed, Margot Robbie truly brings the character of Harley Quinn to life, the costumes, comedy aspects and fight scenes are all up to high standard, I love how they didn't hold back on the violence and truly brought to life the madness/campiness of Harley in a way Suicide Squad failed to deliver due to its 15 Rating. This movie holds no boundaries with its R Rating and it shows.Special shout out to Ewan who once again delivered in an amazing role, I believed every minute of it, the whole cast as a whole was really well put together, I can't say enough how people should go see this movie.I hope this is a success for Margot, she worked hard for this movie to happen and Warner Bros believed in her vision. The only fault I had which is that I wish it was longer.






I went in expecting it to be a flop like Batman V Superman or Justice League; however, I was incredibly surprised by how fun the movie actually was. The film was entertaining the entire way through and the fight sequences were impressive! Definitely a movie I'd rewatch and-or purchase on Blu-ray. Margot IS Harley Quinn, and that's that.






Thoroughly enjoyed this one, my main takeaway was Roman Sionis. I expected that he would just be a filler villain with little depth while Harley takes most of the screen time, but I was wrong. His twisted personality was in full force and earned the R rating. They even included his germ phobia with the gloves. Honestly he might be the best villain since Zod.Action sequences were incredibly fun and the pacing was good. I would have preferred a more linear story with this type of movie but the back and forth wasn't too distracting.This doesn't even feel like a superhero movie, more like an uplifting crime drama. Does that make sense? I can see people watching this after a break up and feel better having seen it. Harley's pain is shown well and you can't help but connect with her.If you love Harley Quinn this is a can't miss as her character is given the needed depth that was so lacking in Suicide Squad. The other supporting ladies also shine in their limited roles.






Birds of Prey was nothing like I expected and was so much better than I expected. Cathy Yan delivers a fresh, stylistic, frenetic, mad joyride of a film. The movie is full of energy, with visceral, jaw-dropping fight sequences and a whole lot of f-bombs, which more than earns the movie's R-rating (and I'm glad it did). Margot Robbie commands the screen as Harley Quinn, but I also want to give credit to Ewan McGregor's Black Mask, who steals every scene he's in. And I can't say enough about Jurnee Smollett-Bell's Black Canary. All I can say is I want more.






ITS MY NEW FAVORITE MOVIE THATS ALL I CAN SAY, marvel fans will hate it BECAUSE ITS AN ART..






I would say this DC universe's Deadpool. Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn was dope. And other characters as well. Indeed it was a very fun movie to watch.






This movie is a absolute blast. Loud, colorful, dopey fun. It owes a lot to "Scott Pilgrim" and that's not a knock. It's a perfect Summer movie......in February.






This movie gives promise of a classic DC team up but realistically is focused on its subtitle (Harley Quinn), although this is a small step up from Suicide Squad it follows it's footsteps in poor pacing and overuse of music. The characters adapted in this movie are poorly portrayed and sadly wasted/ruined for the greater DC universe, this said Robbie continues to shine and new comers Winstead & Smollett-Bell are well casted as their respect BoP members.






On the one hand I'm glad it isn't a burning dumpster fire like Suicide Squad, but this just isn't a good movie to be honest. The writing is messy and the humour was scattershot, trying to mix traditional comic-book movie humour with Deadpool and resulting in a film that feels so conflicted with itself. The acting was generally poor all around, Margot Robbie only stole the show because she's actually trying and is far better in this than in Suicide Squad, and Ewan McGregor did a decent job, but that's about it. The action scenes were fun for the most part and the use of colour was cool, but to call this a "Birds of Prey" movie is so inaccurate. This is a Harley Quinn movie through and through, the Birds of Prey are barely in this movie.This is a massive disappointment, and I won't even get into the reasons to not like this movie if you even care about the feminism and girl power because the film itself is average enough to not be watched again unless I don't feel like watching a good DC film or MCU film. At least it stands out an aims to be experimental and expand on comic-book films like Joker did, so that's at least a good reason as to why this exists.






After reading the reviews I was scared that my ticket purchases were going to be a waste. This movie was really good and would happily go see it again. All the actors in this movie were casted perfectly and the story was very entertaining and keeps you hooked through the whole movie.






You know already from the headline crazy, yeah thats right but in amazing way harley quinn way if you like crazy stuff +comedy +hero complexe this movie is for you if you are not of this type you should also buy a ticket and to to the cinema and watch you love from the earliest moments belive.






It's an entertaining movie, with action and comedy scenes. I liked it more than I thought I would.
It's better than suicide squad.






I rated it a six but it's more towards the seven.This movie is very fun to watch! You just need to take this movie lightly and enjoy the colors and the soundtrack. Margot Robbie does a great job, and the villains are very enjoyable. Action scenes are very well done. The story might be too simple and really not that complex but it was fun to watch.Plus don't go in there expecting a birds of prey movie, this is basically a Harley Quinn movie with some side characters. I loved the fact that Harley Quinn was the main focus but I could see how some people wont like that.It is weird to me that people see him as a villain but then Harley is not that great of a person either and she does most of what he does too. And you're supposed to root for her. It was just weird. You don't really know more about the backstory of the villain, and his best friend was an interesting character I really wanted to know more about him.






It was ok. It looks pretty good, good use of music. Entertaining, and not really a dull moment.
However, a little all over the place.. some of the girlpower feels somewhat forced.I'm sure a lot of haters gonna hate on it, and the woke twitterati will love it, and those who are in the middel will probably think the same as I.It has some pretty darn cool action scenes, but also some of the action felt uninspired. And, and this is not meant as hate, but not all the fighting is believable. You get no reason why these chicks kick so much ass, and they really do. You know, one swift kick and bad guy (twice the size of the hero) goes down.I just wish they would have taken the Atomic Blonde-approach. Women are smaller than men, with less muscle, so maybe have them hit 3 times, instead of one?And how come Harley can beat up several big dudes alone, anyway? She's like, a psychologist? I don't know.It is pretty brutal tho! I liked that.Also, Harley Quinn just walks around town.. no cops or anything try to get her. That's a little strange, maybe. And, she's not really very likeable. The bad guy is sort of more likeable than her, and he's a pretty big douche so.. yeah.






Most fun I've had watching a film for sometime and the first time in years I've immediately wanted to go and see a film again. So much fun from the first minute to last it doesn't let up accompanied by one the best soundtracks I can remember in a very long time! Don't get the hate from some people at all.






This movie. This Movie. I absolutely loved every bit of it. Each character had a character, fighting style, and reason for being there all their own, and no one seemed just thrown in for the heck of it. The choreography was beautiful and contained fighting styles and artistic choices that felt fresh and nor something I've seen before in the superhero genre. The diversity in on-screen characters felt natural, with casual references to characters being lgbtq+ which was lovely. Marvel take notes.The human moments in this movie were especially touching. There were so many little moments between characters that brought so much more meaning in such a short time (being vague to avoid spoilers). The villain was creepy, with some excellent acting from Ewan Mcgreggor.The costuming and set design was colourful and crazy and just precisely Gotham. The comic characters would be right at home in this version of Gotham in my mind. Women wore outfits that were revealing but felt fun and wearable, without the oggling slow-pans up their bodies that I've gotten so used to in movies. Female characters looked human, with visible facial blemishes and messed makeup after fights.Ella Jay Basco's Cassandra Cain was a stand-out for me. Despite having a different backstory from Cass in the comics, I felt that this alternate version of her had a lot of spirit and sass and her Utter Bafflement at What Her Life Had Become was hilarious and expertly acted.This movie made me laugh in the theatre more than any other I've seen in the past year. In the same humor genre as Deadpool 2 without being too similar. 12/10, a must see.






Director: Cathy YanStarring: Margot Robbie, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Jurnee Smollett-Bell, Rosie Perez, Ella Jay Basco, Chris Messina and Ewan McGregorBIRDS OF PREY is a bright and insane world. While it took a bit for this viewer to appreciate the grandiose display of exaggerated violence intermixed with a bit of reality, it became harder and harder to resist as its less than two hour run time went on. Once you get used to the hyper stylized storytelling and direction, you'll find much to enjoy here.Robbie is a wonder as Harley Quinn, and she manages to bring a glorious sense of fun to her morally questionable and selfish anti-hero. While the violence doesn't necessarily seem like it deserves an R-rating , aside from a scene or two , the energy that Director: Cathy Yan creates manages to make this all work in the end. It's certainly not perfect, but with a ton of bright spots - including an ode to Marilyn Monroe.Self-aware, in your face and refusing to apologise for it, D.C., and Harley herself, have hit another home run. The birds of prey and girl power are alive and viciously kicking. 8/10






This movie was so funny and so entertaining. They did a great job on explaining the story with flashbacks and extra information. And who doesn't love Margot Robbie?! Harley Quinn was the best part of Suicide Squad and this movie did not disappoint!






The DC Extended Universe, this is a definitive example of a highly uneven and uncertain track record. The DCEU is a film franchise that brings us "Wonder Woman", a very good superhero flick that finally puts female superheroes into the main spotlight. The same franchise brings us "Batman v. Superman" and "Justice League", which are both considered by many amongst the most disappointing films of the past decade. Now this inconsistent film series brings us its first R- rated entry, "Birds of Prey".And after having seen "Birds of Prey", I admit to being stuck in how I feel about it. I was fairly entertained by the film as I was watching it in the theater. Margot Robbie was the best part of "Suicide Squad" as Harley Quinn, who as a character is a splendid addition to the Batman mythos. And as such, Robbie is also the crucial reason why "Birds of Prey" works at all. Harley is arguably more interesting here as she's given more time to cause havoc amongst many unsuspecting folks in Gotham City.Now that being said, upon further reflection, "Birds of Prey" is a very uneven work from a storytelling perspective and in terms of its tone. Harley Quinn has just broken up with the Joker, who is never seen on-screen. I'm fine with this decision considering that Jared Leto's interpretation of the Joker in "Suicide Squad" was incredibly weak and alienating. After she pulls the bold stint of blowing up the chemical factory where their relationship begin and she was semi-created, Harley opens up even more trouble.An antagonist by the name of Black Mask, played by Ewan McGregor, emerges for "reasons" that aren't even addressed the more I thought about it. McGregor is certainly putting in whatever dedication and effort he can into the role, but I'm not sure what his character's goals are ultimately supposed to be. He's just mad, anxious, and I'm assuming we're supposed to fill in the blanks on the rest. To be fair, the whole world, both good and bad people alike, is out to get Harley Quinn in some way or form.A Gotham police detective, played by Rosie Perez, is eager to take down the Black Mask for the crimes he committed. However, once again, I don't even know what he did that established him as a criminal to begin with. A singer at Black Mask's nightclub, played by Jurnee Smollett-Bell, is reluctantly and randomly tasked with being the Black Mask's car driver, because she saved Harley from being kidnapped. I can't explain why said singer saves her considering there was hardly any buildup to this.The Black Mask is after a young kid, played by Ella Jay Basco, who unknowingly steals a valuable diamond that every villain in Gotham is after. The kid is related to the singer because they live at the same building? I know they shared a scene where the kid is out of her apartment because her parents are arguing over whether to keep her. Anyways, if my plot description is rather sloppy and incomplete, that's because it's accurately reflecting and mirroring how this film tells its story.Anyone who goes into "Birds of Prey" isn't going in for any of the heroes that it's trying to set up or introduce, because they did a sloppy job at setting up what kind of film this is. People like me are going to "Birds of Prey" because we want to see Harley Quinn, and we certainly get what we want on that front. We see her do more malicious and non-sensical deeds. We see her laugh in the face of danger from foes on all fronts. We essentially get more of what we want to see of someone like Harley Quinn.It just barely gets the final score I'm giving it and ultimately my slight recommendation, because Margot Robbie is having a blast in the role. "Birds of Prey" is basically more of the film that "Suicide Squad" was trying to be, but couldn't pull it off. Although in hindsight, some of the problems from "Suicide Squad" do carry over into "Birds of Prey" hence why I slightly feel that this was sort of a missed opportunity. If the film had solely focused on Harley Quinn instead of jamming in these heroes, it would be better for it.






Guys! You want everythinh sexy! and FUN ! go watch BIRDS OF PREY! is totally FUN and its a good plot as well!






This is like the most woke movie I have ever seen.
No, there are no men being replaced by women here,
no there are not outright downgrading of men here,
but simply that all men are depicted as...business like toward women. Even the nicest men Harley knows end up doing something that can be seen as not nice toward her.The story just flows smoothly. The cut are tight and the storytelling is quite entertaining with interesting way to use flashback. The characters are delivered with best performance possible by the actors. Highlights are Rosie Perez's Montoya and Chris Messina's Zsasz. Well, of course Margot Robbie's Quinn is delivered as crazy beautiful girl, and Ewan Mc Gregor's Black Mask is delivered as sadistic flamboyant with great performances, but Montoya and Zsasz are delivered here naturally. Well, as natural as stressed out, underrated smart detective and slice-happy psychopat as possible.Mary-Elisabeth Winstead's Huntress unfortunately is barely in the movie, but when she appears, she's just great. A bit of socially awkward crossbow toting assasin, Black Widow if she's not selling her sexiness if you will.Jurnee Smollet-Bell's Black Canary is so on point. She sings, she kicks, and she screams, and her lineage is taken straight out of comic book too.Everyone's great in this beautiful roller coaster of a movie.






This movie was great. It was entertaining and a lot of fun. Ewan Mcgregor has an amazing performance with some funny dialogue. He has the range to being charismatic and then becoming vicious with his character, Black Mask. Margot Robbie also gave an amazing performance. She's a brilliant actor who plays the role perfectly. The movie also had amazing choreography and fight scenes. This went well with a few of the songs from the soundtrack including "Barracuda" by Heart and "Black Betty" by Ram Jam. The one thing I thought they could improve was the costumes. I didn't like huntress' costume throughout the movie and black canary's could've been better. However, I did like the suits Black Mask wore. Overall I really enjoyed this movie and I recommend it.






Birds of prey and the fantabulous emancipation of one Harley Quinn
2020
15
Director: Cathy Yan
Starring: Margot Robbie, Ewan McGregor, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Rosie Perez, Jurnee Smollett Bell, Ella Jay basco, Chris Massena etc
Overall rating 98/100
Birds of prey focuses on Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) who has broken up with the joker and wants to prove to everyone she is capable of doing things by herself. But when she gets in trouble with Roman Sionis (Ewan McGregor) she must team up with Black Canary (Jurnee Smollett Bell) Huntress (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) and Renee Montoya (Rosie Perez) who have all wronged Roman in order to save Cassandra Cain (Ella Jay Besco) from the wrath of Roman and to stop him from coming under the possession of a precious diamond. Wow what a fantastic movie, tied with joker as my favourite DC movie and one of the funnest film experiences I have ever had. Let's talk about this more in detail.First of all, I loved the unique tone of the film and its visuals and creative set pieces. This film just felt so different and unique to any other film I have ever seen especially for DC. I loved the playful voice narration throughout. The unique humour that's only funny with Harley Quinn. And the story was told in such a fun and unique way that was consistently entertaining throughout. Also, the films visuals were incredibly creative and attention to detail with its set pieces were great. The films visuals were fantastic. Whether it was unique bullets or exploding mustard and glitter instead of blood. They truly went for something different here and it worked so well. Even little things like having pink and blue mist that Harley walks through to match the colour of her hair was great. And the interesting set locations were great whether it was the funhouse to set up an incredibly entertaining final act and action sequences. Harleys flat was interesting and led to some very funny scenes. And even the entrance of the funhouse looking like the animated version of Harley Quinn it was the films attention to detail that I really appreciated.Next, I loved the backstories they gave to the characters and the fact that they still kept Harley as an anti-hero. I loved the amount of detail they went into Harley's background. Really making us understand the reasoning behind her going crazy and almost making us sympathising with her. But I also liked that they added some backstory for Black Canary and Huntress which cleverly linked with all the other characters. But I also loved that they kept Harley Quinn as an antihero. They managed to balance feeling sympathy for her character and liking her. To also knowing that she is still a criminal and that she still made some bad decisions, it just made you like her even more as she went through the inner conflict of being good or bad.Next the film was hilarious, and the action sequences were fantastic and really creative. Wow this made me laugh on multiple occasions. I wasn't expecting to laugh so much. But Margot Robbie playing Harley Quinn was just infectious. And some of the lines she comes out with are just so meant for her character you couldn't help but laugh at the cleverness of the script. The whole female cast also had great comedic chemistry as well, and another humorous part would have to be Harleys narration and the lines of text taking the mick out of all the characters was excellently executed and bought a breath of fresh air to the movie. And the action sequences were brilliantly creative and fun to watch. They had a very john wick/Deadpool vibe to them but yet still felt completely different to any other action scenes I have seen. Margot Robbie surprisingly held her own with some fantastic and unique action sequences. And the final act with the funhouse was one of the funnest times I have had with really unique action sequences involving hands, slanted walls and robotic tongues I know sounds weird and crazy, but it completely works within the film.Now for my one and only slight nit-pick and that is that there were no good male characters and that they were all bad and collectively the enemy. It would have been nice to have some positive male representation within the film as they were shown to be dislikeable and not good people. It wasn't to much of an issue for me because I loved the characters and the film itself, but it would have been nice for more equal gender representation as I fear this could limit its audience slightly.Next, I loved how the narrative was set out and the new characters were great. This film didn't tell the plot narratively in order which I loved. They played a scene and just when the next scene didn't make sense with a particular character, they rewinded the film and played the same scene from a different character's perspective. This was really cleverly done and made the film really enjoyable and it was just a clever and unique way to tell a story that's coherent with no plot holes. And all the new characters really held their own with the clear star of the movie Margot Robbie. There wasn't one weak link. Black Canary and Huntress had great backstories and really entertaining action sequences between them. Cassandra Cain was another great character who had great comedic and on-screen chemistry with Margot Robbie. Roman Sionis or black mask was fantastic. And Renee Montoya was very entertaining and had a good character arc within her workplace as well. But if I had to have key standouts for the new characters it would be Jurnee Smollett Bell as Black Canary and Ella Jay Besco as Cassandra Cain.Now time for my final two positives for the movie. The two stars of the movie and who had the best performances. Margot Robbie and Ewan McGregor. Ewan McGregor was truly fantastic here. He played a completely different role to what I am used to him in but wow he was fantastic. He managed to balance a really campy and funny performance but also a really twisted and uncomfortable performance as well, he did well to hold his own in a female dominated movie so well done to him. But my biggest positive for me would be the star of the film Margot Robbie. Wow what a phenomenal performance. She had it all likeability, humour and holding up well within the action sequences she truly made Harley Quinn my favourite character in DC. I hope we see her reprise her role many times.Overall Birds of prey is tied with my favourite DC movie. With fantastic performances. Fantastic humour and action. Even fantastic script and storytelling and so much more. This shows that Harley Quinn is the role that Margot Robbie was born to play and that DC are finally improving the quality of their movies after years of struggling.
Despite the Birds of Prey being sidelined Birds of Prey: And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn is great fun that's funny, stylish and gleefully violent. Margot Robbie is perfect as Harley Quinn and Rosie Perez, Jurnee Smollet-Bell and Mary Elizabeth Winstead are all great and Ewan McGregor is fantastic in a gleefully over the top performance. Cathy Yan's direction is great and the action sequences are incredible (courtesy of Chad Stahelski). It's well paced, the soundtrack is amazing and the music by Daniel Pemberton is good.






I see the reviews and some of what is said here is crazy. Bathe antagonist is Black Mask. I get they don't build it up as much but they don't need to it's Black Mask. They give you enough to know he is a crazy evil guy. Also the movie is wacky just like you want from a movie starring Harley Quinn. The Suicide Squad Movies she is one of the many here she is the main character so it's going to be crazier and wacky. Go in just looking for a good and fun movie and jus the entertained. Yes it is vulgar and violent and well that's what makes it that much crazier and wacky. Just go see it for yourself and don't expect suicide squad where there is more on the line expect a Harley Quinn movie






Birds of Prey is by far the best DC movie since The Dark Knight. You can feel the passion in this film, all the commitment by the cast and crew to make a fantabulous movie for the fans.
The cast is perfect, the acting is superb, the villain.. Ewan McGregor was absolutely fantastic as Black Mask, he nailed it. And I have no words to describe how Perfect Margot Robbie is. She was born for this. She gives 100% all the time to make everything perfect, she is amazing and the movie is Fantabulous. Go watch Birds of Prey now if you didn't, you won't regret.






I wasn't really sure what to expect not having seen Suicide Squad or really knowing anything about the other characters other than a vague remembrance of an episode from a TV show on The WB about a decade ago, but this was a fun fun movie. I was especially impressed with Harley's flippant fighting style.Ewan McGregor was "the cruelty is the point" incarnate as was his instigating sidekick villain,Zsasz, played by Chris Messina. And I really wouldn't mind a sequel for the actual Birds of Prey crime fighting trio sans Miss Quinn either.






Birds of Prey felt like I'm living every moment of the movie inside of Harley Quinn's mind. I really loved the acting of Mary Elizabeth Winstead. It is nice to see a new face like Huntress.






It's easy to be upset about what this movie isn't. No there's no Barbara yet, no it's not Gotham City Sirens, but for what it is it's actually a very enjoyable movie.Margot robbie was amazing as Harley even more so than in Suicide Squad and after seeing her determination to get this movie made, I truly saw why this project means so much to her. There was no point where it seemed like she was trying to make this movie the Harley quinn show but rather a film that spotlights a multitude of DC women who if not for this movie probably wouldn't have seen the light of day this early in the DCEU.The movie is very funny and has great action scenes, but what makes it most enjoyable is the cast.Jurnee and Mary killed it at Huntress and Black Canary. This movie is meant to be a backdoor pilot for the Birds of Prey team and it does a really great job setting up their stories so they could operate as the team we've come to know from the comics. Rosie perez makes a great performance as Renee. Ewan was FANTASTIC as Black Mask and his dynamic with Victor Zsasz was great to watch.Lastly, although Cassandra Cain isn't the same cassandra we know and love from the comics, Ella Jay Basco does an amazing job portraying the Cassandra we see in the film. I can definitely see her shaping into a more comics accurate version of the character in the future.This isn't the WOKE SJW movie trolls are saying it is. The movie deal with daily misogyny that women have to go through yes but it doesn't come off as an "agenda", it's just things that women today deal with often. A female led movie can be empowering without being dismissed as trying to be woke.






Screenplay was boring. No anticipation at all. The style of the movie is a little like sin city but in full colour. The movie might win and be talked about coz of the all female cast... The actors deserve an applause for their flawless acting.It's worth watching once






An entertaining movie from begining to end. Fantastic acting and action sequences, it loses points because of the basic plot and lack of depth of some characters but if you are looking for a fun action packed experience this is a must watch.






Although I had slightly higher expectations, seeing all the praise on how the action is like John Wick's or how it is very similar to Deadpool, I still find this to be a great movie. The action isn't as near as John Wick's but aren't cheap quick shots that many action fight scenes love to do to save time; It was very much like Pulp Fiction and Deadpool, a narrator narrating different pieces of the story for different characters not so much in chronological order; but this movie doesn't catch as much of the humor that Deadpool had to offer(not to say that's a bad thing). The style of the movie reminded me of Suicide Squad, with it's colorful appeal and all, and the acting was fantabulous. Deserves a 7.4/10 IMDb, 85 percent Rotten Tomatoes, 70 percent MetaCritic.






This movie is a complete entertainment and keeps tou engaged throughout. I love DC characters and how the movies differ feom the comics in this movie. It is a movie and bot a comic series. So do not judge it a whole series. It is a good movie and does not deserve the hate for not being truthful to the comics. If you make it successful.. guss what.. they will develop the team/characters to show more what u what as a comic book fans.






The title is not an exaggeration. I think most will agree that, even though not all the DC movies are bad, most of them are. Birds of Prey is over the top, fun, funny, and just such a fun watch.The movie is very similar to the Deadpool movie. They are both told through a nonlinear narrative; both movies are over the top violent; both movies break the fourth wall in spots; and both movies will have you laughing at the crazy things you're seeing on screen.Margot Robbie was born to play this character. The way she portrays Harley is exactly how you would expect a live action version of the character to be.All the actors and actresses do phenomenal jobs portraying their respective characters, except for Victor Zsazz. This interpretation was just weird.Don't be thrown off by all the bad reviews. This movie is a genuine good time.






Need to give it 10 to make up all low ratings. Movie was fun and enjoyable, I don't get all the hate...






I loved the movie. That's the first thing I've got to say. I've been a Harley Quinn fan since the 90's cartoons, and I thought Margret Robbie nailed it!! I mean she did an amazing job making this crazy character believable. I love how the movie is all narrated by her. The editing is done in a way where it's just as wild as her mind. She goes back and forth explaining everything to us as she sees it. I also love the Joker, and although I was a bit disappointed he wasn't in it, by the time the movie ended I thought it was better without him. This isn't a movie about him... we already have a ton of movies showing us what the prince of darkness is capable of. I've been waiting for a movie about Harley Quinn forever, and this movie really delivers. I partially think most people are too torn up about the Joker dying (as far as she sees it in her mind) and they aren't willing to watch the movie. It's a fun ride and I highly recommend it if you are a fan of Harley Quinn. For me it was as good if not better than the first Deadpool movie. It's quite similar with the narration, R rating, and over the top action. The only difference is that the other characters think she is crazy since she talks to us as though she is talking to herself, and sometimes forgets who she's talking to. I loved it and already want to watch it again.






This movie was structured differently,every scene was like a comic book!It was something different that i enjoyed!Margaret(harley quin) made an amazing performance. In addition, the
fight scenes,the humor,the make up, the costumes and the soundtrack were amazing.However the movie was lacking with the some characters but that's not a big problem!The movie is enjoyable af and for sure you wipl laugh and have fun!🔥






I went in with low expectations but ultimately I was really entertained by this. I agree that the film is akin to a female version of Deadpool. Robbie's accent annoyed me to begin with but by the end I didn't notice it. Great cast, didn't take itself too seriously and didn't sugarcoat the abusive Joker/Quinn relationship.






Movie has great action first of all. Like john wick great. On top of that, its funny. Like deadpool funny. So basically a deadpool x john wick baby. But its way more awesome with the female cast kicking butt and Ewan killing it as black mask.






Birds of Prey is not trying to do what most MCU movies do and reach a broad audience. It's aimed at women who have been beaten down in life, whether by men in power, societal pressures, poverty, etc. To someone who hasn't experienced those things, characters may seem underdeveloped. But I didn't find this to be the case. The movie uses quite a bit of shorthand that many women will understand so that it doesn't need to spend too long on the backstories of five different women, and can instead jump into creating a dynamic between them. My favorite interactions were those between Harley and Cassandra, and those between Harley and Dinah.That's not to say this is a perfect film. The first 20-30 minutes jump around in multiple different time-frames, and can be difficult to follow. Once it gets rolling in a chronological structure, this problem disappears, and it becomes a well-paced wild ride. Secondly, many people have pointed out that the movie focuses much more on Harley than it does on the Birds of Prey. This is 100% true. If you're coming to see a Harley Quinn movie (which to be fair, is largely how it was marketed) you will be very satisfied. If you wanted more of a Birds of Prey movie, you may be disappointed. Finally, I'm not well-versed in the comic book lore behind most of these characters, but as I understand it the movie takes a lot of liberties with them, and their movie counterparts are essentially different people. This could upset fans of the books who were hoping to see these characters represented on-screen.However, if you're willing to look past these things (as I was) and you pick up on a lot of the subtext and implications, this is an incredible movie. In addition, the cinematography makes it a treat to the eyes. You could pause on almost any moment and have a great picture for your desktop. Finally, the action is fantastically choreographed, shot well, and the lighting makes it easy to see what's going on.I highly recommend this movie.






Birds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn) is by far the greatest comic book movie, especially for DC. Once again Margot Robbie shines as Harley Quinn, delivering a fun-filled and deranged carnival ride. Everyone brought their A-game to this film. It's an action-packed, R-rated, hysterically funny movie that you have to watch on the big screen! Grab your popcorn and get ready for a violent, kick-ass ride with everyone's favorite bad girl: Harley Quinn!






This was literally the same quality as Suicide Squad. Action was very well done. Acting, dialogue, story, and pretty much everything else was really hard to watch.






Every one talks about women empowerment... Well this is what happens when they go outta control.. yes,,, suffer it!!!






Yeah, no. Just seeing his face for the hundredth time for the last couple years was enough to make this movie suck. And how sweet and savory was the ending when he blew up into million pieces
Would have gave more stars but the story was a total disaster, Huntress & Rene cast wrongly but the comedy genius of Margot Robbie & Ewan McGregor as black mask got me through the movie. Both of the writer's & director should be sacked & replaced if they are to make a sequel.






If you didn't like Suicide Squad but loved Margot Robbie's performance as Harley Quinn, you'll love this movie. Set after the events of Suicide Squad, the film shows Harley after she breaks up with the Joker (Leto, not Phoenix) as she teams up with other pals on a mission to wreck Gotham City. See this in a theater before it leaves. I saw it in Laser Imax and enjoyed the colorful cinematography and bone crushing sound. Make sure you stay at the very end for a funny post credit scene.
I mean it's better than suicide squad at least even tho I saw it for free at a cinema I still feel as if I've been robbed






Seriously half the ratings didn't watch this movie. It is really good! Dc is back on track i loved this one better than Shazam and Aquaman. Margot was born to play Harley






Im a marvel fan and i didn't expect to like this film so my expectations were really low but i have to say, its an amazing film. Its so fun, exciting and action filled that the movie had ended and didn't realize that i had been in the movie theater for so long. The actresses were outstanding (especially Margot) and the fight scenes were epic






Here it is, what I've been waiting for, the first mainstream comic adaptation that actually has style, takes risks with its story and feels personal to its director. There is a clear director voice here and it drips through every scene throughout. The movie is very hyperactive and has a habit of jumping all over the place (There are sequences where the film will speed up, have a choppy frame rate and become really absurdist, which might turn some viewers off) but I think it's a great narrative choice. This perfectly mirrors the personality of Harley Quinn and the narration ties into this idea and elevates the female perspective of the film in a big way.Margot Robbie is fantastic as Harley Quinn using charisma and a wide array of dynamic facial expressions to really sell her character. The side characters are great too with Rosie Perez and Ewan McGregor being standouts in particular. I can't get over how many hilarious scenes there is of McGregors freaking out, it really must be seen to be believed. There is also a self-aware element to the film which playfully acts as a commentary on cliched superhero films but it's never to an annoying or pretentious extent.The themes tie into the personal element of the film. Harley's journey of independence from the joker, her captors and the trap of her own life is very relatable and resonant. I think this also mirrors Cathy Yan's own rise in the film industry as she is a newcomer, seeks her own lane and plays to the studio system in her own way. This is why the film feels unique because it actually incorporates the journey of its creators into the film itself. While I feel some of the exposition choices are lacking, could've been more attention on certain characters and there are some bizarre choices here and there (particularly the ending) I absolutely loved this. Not only is it fun, crazy and ballsy but it has a personal element that really speaks to the unique narrative voice the director has. Make more films like this, please.






This movie was great! Robbie is amazing as Harley once again! Ewan as Black mask is perfect! Definitely recommend, don't listen to the hate.






I liked the movie. It was entertaining. Sometimes it was as disjointed as Harley Quinn's mind. It was a fun movie. Not perfect, but what movie is, amirite? Gonna see it again.






The set pieces are fantastically staged and Quinn brings plenty of craziness, glamour, humour and her unique perspective to the proceedings. Add this to the outlandish style, catchy music and well put together action scenes and it makes it an enjoyable and entertaining film to watch. However, the story itself is rather pedestrian and has a bitty start and a long explanation phase. The villains aren't really done justice and although the acting is good, the supporting cast don't really shine - maybe Robbie just steals the show too much.






Birds of Prey takes the DC comic-book films back to basics after going artsy on us with Joker. Here's what I foresaw from the get-go (because it's easy to envision the future with films like this): "Birds of Prey isn't really going to be that different from the previous time Margot Robbie portrayed beloved Joker sidekick Harley Quinn in terms of filmmaking quality, but it will be more overtly female-empowering in its themes and action, ergo the critics will let it slide". And I don't think they strictly would have, were it not for the fanboys; now there's someone out there to spite.What makes Birds of Prey potentially worse off than Suicide Squad, which still did well financially, is that it falls into the modern habit of pandering to a crowd that will ensure better reviews, at the expense of the only sorts who would excitedly pay to see a Suicide Squad-type stinker in theatres. Nerds like that tend to be the most offended at inclusive, anti-patriarchal platitudes, so why alienate the only people who would've secured financial success (it's not like the average comic-book audience attends a film based on approval from critics)? Of course, anti-fanboy comments didn't harm Captain Marvel's box office. Is the popularity of Joker and Shazam gonna save this one? Will the progressive attitude make it succeed with another audience, even though this failed to salvage Charlie's Angels? Is the brand gonna help that? We'll see.I do agree that this is better than Suicide Squad (if I'm even allowed to acknowledge that film, what with James Gunn's forthcoming reattempt at a Suicide Squad stand-alone flick within the DCEU). It's superior in terms of characterization, cohesive editing, watchable color-grading, and having settled for one consistent tone by the time of filming - not having to make it a comedy in post with obnoxious graphics and hip music. Now we have something that's exhaustingly cartoonish throughout (Harley was already prone to getting old fast).The main character is definitely crazed ex-therapist Harley Quinn, despite the Birds of Prey comics ordinarily being ensemble pieces, and the fact that she is slightly more human than the ditzy sex object we last saw Robbie play has been enough for people to preemptively name the film either horrible or excellent. The rest include Rosie Perez as Officer Montoya, Jurnee Smollett-Bell as metahuman Black Canary, and last but not least, Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Huntress, who will be the forthcoming subject of "This is totally me" memes for girls who aren't preppy enough to communicate their supposed quirkiness via the Harley imagine macros. I take back what I said; DC knows precisely which audience to go for.The baddie this time is Black Mask (Ewan McGregor), whom I've known since teenhood as the DC mythos' equivalent to Red Skull, although his weirdly colored skull is merely a spooky mask worn by a cartoonishly sexist mob boss, don't you worry. His goons, including another well-known Batman villain named Zsasz (Chris Messina), are after a young diamond-stealer named Cassandra Cain (Ella Jay Basco), one of Batgirl's alter-egos from the comics. Initially, some of the Birds of Prey are also after Cassandra, in accordance with Black Mask's bounty, or each other. The team proper isn't formed until the finale, in fact, but I guess the film's subtitle prevents its main title from being all too misleading.The heroines engage in ambitiously shot fight scenes, but the lack of quick cuts (although they're usually an annoyance) makes the occasional choreography hiccups too obvious. I suppose I should suspend my disbelief and enjoy the spectacle without nitpicking, but why settle with what's put before me when long-take fight scenes like those of Oldboy exist? Why pretend this is the best we can do?I don't know. I don't know how to review this in such a way that anyone from either side will hear me out, because I'm not inflating my verdict one way or the other, based on who I'm trying to annoy. I try to look at what's actually happening on the screen and how I feel about those things - one of several reasons I have my doubts I will ever get to do this as anything more than a hobby.I fear I am welcome amongst neither published film critics nor YouTube ranters (exceptions including the likes of YourMovieSucks and RedLetterMedia, since one gets the impression that they're sincerely sharing their opinions on the filmmaking, rather than largely basing the verdict on how feminist and/or anti-male they perceive the overall attitude to be). But then, I never did think fitting into one group was a virtue. Guys, what if I'M the Joker? So edgy!I appreciate the usage of Björk's "It's Oh So Quiet" in the trailer, though. I'll give you one half of a point extra for that.






A lot of conversations have flown around the quality and the message of this film. And in all fairness this is an okay movie, it's not bad, it's not good, it's just okay.In the great pantheon of Comic Book Movies I think this one shouldn't even be in the top twenty-five. It has nice set pieces, a few good action bits and a good soundtrack, I'll give it that.Margot Robbie is amazing as Harley Quinn, and Rosie Perez delivers an amazing performance as Detective Renee Montoya, that's pretty much it, other than that is a pretty by-he-numbers film, a pop corn movie with very few laughs.Jurnee Smollett-Bell is unrecognizable as Black Canary, she was pretty much thrown into the mix and the character could have been called any other name and it wouldn't have made a difference. Mary Elizabeth Winstead, who is famous for starring in Final Destination and Scott Pilgrim vs. the world phones it in as Huntress, but the worst of the bunch is Ewan McGregor, he plays Black Mask in a way that's very reminiscent to Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor, in a very flamboyant and colorful way that makes him more of a spoiled brat than a feared villain.The message was loud and clear, too. If you have heard people saying this movie does not have one good male character who's not a prick, an incompetent jerk, an imbecile or a would-be-rapist, believe them.This movie would have worked a whole lot better if it was a Harley Quinn solo project, as the group dynamic feels incredibly forced.Let's hope Harley finds the Gotham City Sirens, but then again, if it might end up like this movie, perhaps is better if she doesn't.






Let's start by saying I liked the whole thing except one cheesy scene with the Black Canary (you'll know it when you see it). It was worth it.It's much better than Ocean's Eight at its social commentary, it's trying to be Deadpool when it comes to humor, it sometimes, momentarily, gets as dark as the Phoenix's Joker (movie). It has unhinged, quirky narration, explosions, mallets and baseball bats. No comment on bat men, but I think everyone's happy there's no Leto's Joker (character).This is a surprisingly good mixture, a well layered atmosphere, like a good sandwich. It fits the character and really deserves an 8, 8.5 by itself. However, the story itself is... well, obvious from the title itself, the finale felt extremely tame, even awkward, compared to the thrilling earlier scenes, and the villain could be written much better towards the end, for example by attempting what his right-hand-man tried earlier, for another layer of atmosphere.Like finding some foil in your otherwise great breakfast.






Okay, I usually don't expect to much from superhero movies. First and foremost I want to have fun with not much brain activity . And this one was kindaaaaa fun. I enjoyed soundtrack and some fight scenes! Other than that, this movie is a missed opportunity. Lousy acting and shallow characters... specially bad guys. Overall... I'm giving it 5,5 out of 10






Honestly, I think this movie is easily the best thing that's come out of the DCEU since they decided they wanted a piece of Marvel's action. The acting is great, the story is enjoyable and actually makes since, everything moves along at a rapid clip so it's never boring, and there's no massive, god awful, never ending CGI battle sequence at the end. Is it the greatest movie ever made? No. Will it satisfy as a Friday night popcorn flick? Absolutely! I had fun watching it, and I think you will too. Forget about the burning trash heap that is Suicide Squad, and give this movie a chance. It works perfectly well as a stand-alone feature and you don't need any back story going into it. Enjoy!






As always margot Robbie killed the role of Hartley Quinn. Very colourful and good looking movie. Was actually quite funny. All main characters had a good backstory and were all interesting. Definately better than I expected.






The fact that this film was released in the dead of winter, traditionally the time when cinematic mistakes are dumped, should not mislead you. This is a hell of a good popcorn movie, the one Suicide Squad was intended to be, with Margot Robbie's encore performance as Harley Quinn delivering once again all the snarky humor, action and appalling psychopathology that the fates decided Jared Leto's Joker just wasn't meant to. The reason it works so well this time, first, is that the charismatic Harley is now the center of attention, and second, they seem to have finally gotten the idea that a comic book movie, however dark, is supposed to be FUN.It's a seriously overstimulating film (a fight almost broke out at the screening I attended) with lots of cartoonish ultraviolence, a lickety-split pace and more candy colored bling than the Claire's at your local mall. I saw it and 1917 on the same day and I honestly couldn't tell you which was the greater cinematic achievement.Favorite line: "I'm a PhD, Mr!"






If you're looking for a bright, funny action film with some iconic comic characters, please watch. I went with someone who knows very little about the universe, but still enjoyed the movie.
If we're comparing it to Joker, it's the exact opposite feel. It's really just a joyride. Don't go in looking for any deep messages. It's more upbeat, with a few serious scenes that really establish the threat. Warning, there is a scene with sexual harassment that was very jarring, and it's definitely a rated R film in regards to the swearing and violence.
Personally, I left the theater wanting more, immediately planning to watch it again in a day or two and I convinced a few friends to come with me. The music is really outstanding. It's about as absolutely crazy as you'd expect from a story told from Harley Quinn's POV.
The acting is phenomenal, the action scenes are freaking fantastic, and I'm excitedly awaiting the next time I get to see Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn. She was made for the role!After a stressful first month of the year, this movie was exactly what I needed to shrug off the bad, and get ready to fight whatever life throws at me. A must-see film, even if you don't typically watch superhero stuff!






This movie is great! And by that, I mean it's terrible. The great YMS once said: "it's not as bad as Suicide Squad." That may be true, but only by a razor-thin margin.This movie tries way too hard to be cool in a very Deadpool-y way, but it's way more cringy than Deadpool. It's truly embarassing to think that this was made by adults, for adults.Every single character is annoying. The plorlt is needlessly complicated and some plot points make about zero sense. Full of jokes, and 98% of them are absolutely unfunny. Annoying overuse of well-known songs. A few good action scenes.Many people who are incapable of forming their own opinions, or of thinking deeply, will likely really like this. Sad, really.






A low quality movie like many other dc movies. I was hoping for another Suicide Squad type movie (one of dcs not horrible movies) but instead got a movie trying to convey a message about culture instead of making a dope dc comic movie. They entire film summarized "men are perverts and women are all powerful". Don't take this as women are worse than men or they don't deserve equality or respect or something like that at all I believe they deserve all of those things, but this movie literally has no redeeming men at all, every guy is a perv and makes you want to punch them in the face, it drops the movie down because no one enjoys so many scenes that make you grossed and pissed at every dude in the movie. There are so so many underlying messages and lines about feminism and whatnot, which is not bad in real life OK, but dang it I just want a good dc movie about comics and super hero's. Also the girls only team up for like 2 minutes so there is not unified team that you root for in a movie just a ton of side plots and individual story lines that leave you wanting more. Boom that's it.Wait there are 2 good parts, 1 the dope bat hit and 2 the hyena.
Not spoilers ^^^






This movie is AMAZING. It is violent, hilarious, quirky and action packed. It is full of great acting, awesome style and a spectacular. I truly don't know how you can not enjoy this movie. It's no best picture winners but it was never going to be. It is all it had to be and better. I find it hard to believe Anyone can not enjoy this. Lots of the bad reviews are saying there was too much feminism in it but I honestly could barley spot much feminism in it at all, it is female led but that doesn't make it a total feminist movie. Even if you thought there was to much feminism in it that's one small part that you didn't like. I'm not saying you have to like it I am just you need to go there and try enjoy it for what it is and not critique the whole movie. I think what many people have forgotten is movie are made to be enjoyed not to be picked to shreds. So please next time you go to a movie enjoy the movie for what it is and don't compare it just enjoy






Birds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn) is the eighth film in the DCEU and probably contender for one of the longest titles ever for a film. Despite the film being called Birds of Prey, which was a team comprise of women superheroes,this film is really a Harley Quinn movie. The movie is even narrated and told in the perspective of Harley Quinn. They probably should've called the movie Harley Quinn and friends. I loved Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn from Suicide Squad despite how garbage that movie was so it is great to see her star in her own film.One of the things I loved about this movie was the fact that it gave a relatively realistic portrayal of Harley Quinn dealing with the breakup with Joker. She didn't just move on straight away, she swallowed herself in sadness and anger before accepting her new self. I also have to praise the rest of the cast and characters as well. Jurnee Smollett-Bell shines as Black Canary by giving a bad women character and Mary Elizabeth Winstead for giving a ferocious performance as Huntress. It is a real shame however, that for a film called Birds of Prey, we don't actually to get see much of the "Birds of Prey". Ewan Mcgregor gives a great performance as Black Mask despite how poorly written the character is. There is honestly nothing about Black Mask, he is just a typical villain with no depth to himself whatever or even genuine motivation or backstory. He wants power and diamonds and that is all there is to him. On the other hand, despite the small screentime Chris Messina is able to give a fair amount of character towards the secondary villain Victor Zsasz. This is based on a source material so I have to give a nod to the fact that the character of Cassandra Cain played by Ella Jay Basco is butchered and kind of pathetic. Movies of course don't have to be the same as the source material and the change to the character was necessary for Harley Quinn and the story they were telling. However, there is no really stand out moments from Cassandra Cain with the only memorable thing was stealing and getting saved all the time. A shame really.Despite the relatively lower budget of this film compared to typical superhero movies, the action scenes are phenomenal and well choreographed. Additionally, the soundtrack is unique and adds towards the movie. The movie also has a great visual style with colourful sets and storytelling with a chaotic order that adds to Harley's character. Still, the screenplay is not great honestly. Some of the dialogue are quite cheesy,generic or lacking in genuine banter between the characters. By the end of the film, I didn't really feel like the bond between these characters were earned or should even exist. I also think it should be noted that this is a feminist film and it really shows. For example, there is not even remotely one good male character in this entire film. It really pushes the women power message straight in your face which could have been done a little better.Nevertheless, despite the flaws, this movie continues to be a step in the right direction for the DCEU and I hope Warner Bros continues to maintain and exceed this quality of superhero movies. To anyone reading this, I recommend giving this movie a watch because even if there are some issues with the movie, you will still come out feeling that you had a good time.






When a cartoon can put the characters better than this movie is a shame. i cant believe they ruined bop characters. the movie started well for the first 20 minutes but it falls off. fighting scenes are great but plot of this story is slow and missplaced all the time. it makes no sense but black mask and everyone else wants to kill harley after her break up from joker. the movie is c- grade. the action scenes kept it from a failure. the characters in this movie is not that bright the way half of em acted but they seem to hate men so much. for the female empowerment movie it should be it turned out to be female just trashed men all the dam time. this is a harley movie not a bop movie. they wouldve done better to introduce batgirl or oracle. they shouldve added harley best friend ivy in this movie too. its just total waste of space characters in this movie for a 5 minute thrill and actin scenes. i rather go watch suicide squad again than this crap.






U must be an idiot to think this movie is great b/c of action scenes. the plot is rip off of deadpool 2. the worst part they ruin that plot too. they cant even tell a proper story in this movie. alot of cussing to make it rated r passing. you must think half of us are retartds is why its rated r. they give some background history on some of these characters from the comic iteration but dam you make some of these characters dumb. no proper flow in this movie. half the time im looking at my watch to see if 30 minutes went by this slow crap of movie. action scenes are the best part of this movie that saves it from total failure. women bashing on men is not cool in this movie. you have to be ignorant to enjoy men bashing stuff.






Please delete your accounts. You are not able to think differentiated and therefore not able to write a factual review. Hardly any movie deserves a rating of 1. This is disrespectful to the people who invested a lot of energy and passion into this film. You are disappointed because the movie didn't deliver what the trailer promised you? Why do you watch trailers of movies you want to see? What can a trailer show you that the film can't? That doesn't make any sense to me.
I don't even want to start with the white, old men who feel threatened in their masculinity by the film.
Anyway.
If I'm watching a Harley Quinn movie, I want to watch exactly a movie like that. Very cartoony, totally over the top, high pacing, high gag level and visual fireworks. The cast was well chosen and believable. A small point of criticism is the lack of depth of some characters. I hope we will learn more about them in possible sequels.






I don't even understand how anyone could enjoy this crap movie or even rate it higher than a 4 or 5. Stay away at all costs. It's better to not watch this film at all and to just go do something more beneficial like smoking meth or stabbing your leg with a spoon because those activities are way more enjoyable than sitting through this sorry excuse of a film






This movie is trash, they ruined most of their key character. the only good character is harley and black mask. this movie shouldve been called harley b.c. they miss the ball on the bop characters. plus they ruined cassandra cain character to be 2 bit thief. the worst part they tried deadpool 2 story in here to befriend cassandra cain. how can they bring in this girl since i know she becomes an assassin at a young age just like her parents then later taken in by batman as his 2nd batgirl. speaking of batgilrl, she wasnt in this movie not even as oracle. biggest character from the franchise comic books to be missing. i hope this movie flops hard. i rather go see suicide squad at least it had a story even thought their villain they dont need in it






This movie is a huge disappointment, i cant believe it suppose to be about women empowerment but they ruined the most strongest badass character cassandra cain. They ruin birds of prey characters from the comics. I plan to go watch the tv series instead to get rid of bad taste. It started well in the beginning but went crazy dumb toward the end. seriously killing off characters and made zasz annoying joker 2.0, the gotham series made zasa better. Black mask seem to be bi polar stupid idiot. This movie tried to be deadpool 2 and it still sux. the plot is a mess. No actual story. It is just hey everyone wants to kill harley. This is mostly a harley movie. They shouldve at least add in batgirl in this movie or even female villain to face off against the bop and harley. The so called bop was good for action scenes only.






If I had the flexibility and the supernatural mobility to kick myself in the nuts, I'd have spent my night doing that rather than watching this tripe.Overacting, crud story, third wave feminist man hating script, ott fight scenes, no real character development and confusing and slow plot.Literally every male character in this movie is either a creep, killer, betrayer or general doofus. There's not one likable male character in the whole movie. They trying to say something?And Harley Quinn looks ill in this movie. It should be renamed The horrendistic emaciation of one Margot Robbie.






After reading so many negative reviews of this movie here I finally decided to write my own. So from all the reviews I can say that most of the people haven't even seen the movie. Some are calling it boring but trust me, boring is the only thing the movie isn't. It's a fast paced entertaining package!The acting is mind blowing by everyone especially Margot Robbie and Ewan Mcgregor (as expected). Huntress is a show stealer and was the biggest surprise for me.The soundtrack is just amazing and badass. It even surpasses Suicide Squad's soundtrack for me. Every song matches with the storyline and mood.Now talking about the feminism, trust me there's isn't any. The movie just has 5 female leads and that's all. There's no unnecessary hating on men which others are telling.This movie is amazing for single viewing for entertainment. If you are looking for something more than entertainment and expect real art, stay away from this.So at last I'd sayActing- 10/10
Story- 6/10
Cinematography- 8/10
Action- 10/10
Soundtrack - 9/10
Entertainment- 100/10Overall- 9/10 (giving it a 10 here because it doesn't deserve the 6.6 rating it has right now)






I really enjoyed this film and I'm not a fanboy or critic. I didn't see Suicide Squad so I walked into this as an outsider. For a popcorn flick I was pleasantly surprised by the way it felt as if it was two films in one. Yes HQ did dominate, but did anyone think that this was a decision made because an HQ exclusive movie wouldn't satisfy? Birds of Prey needed a backstory so we got a 2 for 1 deal. DC is not constrained by ratings and are trying to appeal to an adult audience (like Joker before), but will probably suffer in the end. I have to say this one satisfied. Seeing it in the Dolby Theatre was great. Black Canary hitting her first note early on was a great use of low frequencies which rocked my world. Margot is awesome in pretty much anything she touches...






Okay, so as a die hard Harley Quinn fan (and one of her toughest critics) I don't think that Margot Robbie is the best casting choice for her even though I love her as an actress! That being said she definitely did a MUCH better job on her character work in this film than the previous Suicide Squad where she was much more objectified. She seemed to have more freedom to be the silly and fun HQ we all know and love.My only qualms with the film were that they seemed to just throw in material from the comics with no explanation, which I guess might make them easter eggs? I really would have loved it if Harley would have had a conversation with her taxidermy beaver "Bernie" like in the books! I also would have loved to see more of a roller derby scene since that's such a large part of Harley's life in the comics. I also felt that Huntress' character was a bit awkward and flat but she still managed to land some punches! I also wouldn't have minded more blood.Now I'm not saying this movie is the work of art we've found "Dark Knight" or "Joker" to be, but it definitely serves it's purpose in being extremely entertaining. When I wasn't busy laughing off, I was completely captivated by the colorful and almost psychedelic like visuals and feel, and completely in awe of the fighting sequences. The film felt like it was almost like viewing the world through Harley's eyes.I'm really not sure why people are saying this film has a strong feminist agenda or that it's racially biased because I didn't sense that at all! The people saying that must be extremely repelled by women and multiracial people.The reason for going to the movies is to be entertained and this movie does exactly that! Don't believe it or give into the haters that want to bash this film just so they can feel like their voices are being heard. This was worth every penny and I'd go see it again! 10 stars for reminding me why I love going to the movies and feeling like a kid again (and to help counter all those pointless 1 star ratings)!






Considering that as this film came out after the colossal success that was the Joker, I feel that this film was always going to disappoint some people and confuse others who might have thought it was set in the same timeline. Just to be clear this film is classic DC comic book film, nothing like the dark and gritty social commentary that was the Joker. This film doesn't even feature the Joker apart from in a short cartoon at the start. The film is more akin to Suicide Squad.I was somewhat pleasantly surprised and marginally underwhelmed by Birds of Prey. The film started off as an interesting quirky story about Harlequin going it alone and learning a few things in the process. It was full of colour, cartoons and the odd joke. However the film slowly descends into a bland and drab picture with many missed opportunities, which left me disappointed as I genuinely enjoyed the characters in the film and would like to see more of them in a much more action packed, crazy, colourful adventure.DC needs to be more bold here. If you're going to make a film about a quirky character then add lots of colour, humour, over the top action and WTF moments. Don't play it safe like this movie tried to do as that ultimately made the film underwhelming and tonally all over the place. For instance in one scene Harley Quinn is battling with some thugs in a police confiscated property office. The thugs shoot a pallet of drugs which causes everyone to get high. At this point I was expecting a massive drug fuelled fight scene with crazy colours, visions and over the top action. Instead what we got was a quite short and bland fight scene. This is one of many missed opportunities to really add some character to the film and give it that crazed Harley Quinn feel. But instead they opted for a weirdly bland fight in which people are getting their badly CGI legs broken. This is one of many missed opportunities throughout the film.The pacing of the film was a major dampener as well as the film introduced a bit of action, humour or drama for about a few minutes then immediately cut away to something else with a completely different tone. It just meant that nothing felt impactful, nothing was really that memorable and the film never really built to anything. It also really undermined the humour in the film which was a real let down. The actors tried but they were given really bad dialogue and bland jokes which at most would get a small chuckle out of the audience at the cinema. Perhaps a longer run time would have allowed the characters and plot to have been developed more thoroughly as well as having longer and more varied fight scenes.Also there were moments in the film where the cinematography changed to more of a comic book feel. These scenes always felt a bit out of place as the cinematography in the rest of the film was nothing special. This is something they should have added more into the film. Giving a unique comic book feel would have made the film more of a visual spectacular and given the film the right tone.Onto the good. I really like Margot Robbie's quirky Harley Quinn interpretation and Mary Winstead as the Crossbow Killer, and thought the other actors did a decent job throughout the film although felt neither really had a good opportunity for character development in the film. We never really got to hear what they were thinking that much just them reacting to things around them. It leaves their characters feeling a bit underdeveloped and hollow.I would like to see a sequel to this film where DC really ramp up the quirkiness, over the top action, surreal-ness and humour to really separate it from every other comic book film. I also would be interested in seeing a Crossbow Killer gritty and dark spin off with Mary Winstead. Something akin to the darkness of the Girl With The Dragon Tattoo to give the Crossbow Killer the dark and gritty world which I believe she deserves rather than the half badass assassin half awkward comic side relief they tried and failed to do in this film.The film also has a great almost all female cast without constantly beating you over the head to tell you how amazed you should be that they cast women as lead roles in comic book/action films for once (looking at you Captain Marvel). All good actors in their own right that deserve a better opportunity at creating the Harley Quinn universe than this films script gave them. Look forward to seeing more of them in hopefully the sequel with a much better story.6.5/10
If watching Marvel movies is the equivalent of going to an amusement park, then watching the first entries into the DC universe ("Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice", "Suicide Squad") is the equivalent of watching an incredibly drunk person try to do gymnastics. It's still somewhat amusing, but it's certainly nothing special."Birds of Prey" started off rambling incoherently, just like the majority of DCU movies. The first forty-five minutes are essentially the film boasting about how crazy it is without ever really showing us that craziness. Continuing my metaphor: it's like a drunken cheerleader telling us she's going to do a triple backflip, but she never lines up to do it. Then, finally, after forty-five minutes of boasting about its (her) skills, the film (our drunken cheerleader) actually takes a few steps forward, lining up to do its (her) trick, and though it (she) stumbles in the first few steps and looks awkward when it (she) finally leaps into the air, the film (she) does that triple backflip, and lands, just barely, standing.While what you would have witnessed wouldn't have been pretty, I'd bet you'd still be surprised that inebriated person was left standing at the end of the trick, and that's exactly how I felt at the end of this movie. There were so many bad moments, so many mediocre moments, so many downright annoying moments, that even I am surprised I gave this film a passing grade. Still, I guess it's not that bad. It's just not that great either.






So, first up - Movie people; stop spoiling all the good bits in the trailers... It's just, very, very annoying, and makes a movie less than it could be.This is a fun little tale about the start of the Birds of Prey and Harley Quinn's breakup from the Joker. Now everyone in Gotham seems to want to kill her.This is a strange heist movie, action flick, super hero caper and it has fun bits throughout but not enough to make me care about most of the characters or the storyline. Which is a shame as so much of this film is good.






First, the cast: Margot Robbie's performance as Harley was stunning and I thought even better than in Suicide Squad. Next to her stood Ewan McGregor as Black Mask who I thought was also a wonderful cast choice and did not disappoint with his interpretation. I walked in open-minded for the Birds and was pleasantly surprised by Huntress (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) who I would love to see again, but on the other hand, not convinced of Jurnee Smollet's Black Canary (who btw happens to be one of my favourite DC heroines). I'm always open for multiple interpretations of already established comic book characters, but something in her depiction lacked that gave me NO Canary vibes at all. Else, Chris Messina as Victor Zsasz was trouble-free to watch so that I was definitely fine with it, but nothing outstanding. Ella Jay Basco's performance as Cassandra Cain was good acting-wise, but the writing of the character maybe not bad, but also very plain with space to work with. Would love to see her grown to the badass she's known for! And well, Renee Montoya, I hate to criticize, but she was the weakest of them all. The plot wouldn't be much different without her so that it's not just Rosie Perez "fault" but the writing.All in all, the script was mediocre, but it was very fun to watch and visually great. The 'feminism' people seem to be put off by is subtly applied, thus not try-hard at all. It's just a movie with strong fighters as leads that happen to be females, nothing to complain! This comes from someone who's easily irked (not angered!) by 'in-your-face-feminism'.If you're going to watch this, please do it without expectations, don't hope for an oscar-worthy movie, be open for it and you will certainly enjoy it just as I did :)!






Enjoyable movie. Highly recommended. And please ignore the negative reviews






I really enjoyed this movie mostly because the cast had just a huge charm to them. They all gelled well together and seemed to enjoy the material. Ewan mcgregor was phenomenal casting as Black Mask, he really stole the show in a movie with a great cast






This movie was so much fun! I loved it. So many funny moments. It was a blast!






*****Let me just get a technicality out of the way first: my actual score is 8.75*****Where to start with this movie...I think the best place to start is when it was announced; When Birds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn) was first announced, I was 100% ON board! I thought "Another Suicide Squad-esque movie with (Margot Robbie's) Harley Quinn!? Yes please!!!" THEN, I started reading all this stuff about LGBTQ representation and was pretty much diving OFF board! Factor into all that how neither of the 2 trailers made the movie look good AND the (mostly) HORRIBLE soundtrack! All that being said, I was pleasantly surprised!I think the best way to describe this movie is "DC's Deadpool"; I don't just mean they're both rated R comic book movies, but B.o.P. (like Deadpool) has a non-linear story (which is a personal pet peeve of mine and accounts for one missing star from my score).B.o.P. has lots of action (a lot of reviews claimed it was lacking in that department), (good) humor and it's nowhere near as political as a Disney movie (Captain Marvel, I'M TALKING ABOUT YOU)! As for the LGBTQ aspects of the movie: In the very beginning of the movie (in the animated intro.) there's a slot machine that shows both genders while Harley summarizes her love life; We find out that Renee Montoya (Rosie Perez) is lesbian only because Harley mentions it in narration; Although Ewan McGregor's Black Mask (the villain) is VERY flamboyant, neither he nor his second-hand-man Victor Zsasz (Chris Messina) ever kiss/have sex with other men/each other so I don't know what all the fuss about the villain(s) being gay/bisexual was about? The movie also has some subtle feminist undertones and a quick jab at "rich white men", but again, not nearly as blatant/nauseating as Cap. Marvel!As for the characters: I do agree with a lot of people that the movie focused too much on Harley simply because other awesome characters (Jurnee Smollet-Bell's Black Canary and Mary Elizabeth Winstead's Huntress) didn't get as much screen time as they deserved; however, it did set up for a sequel/sequels and within that setup, it righted what I thought was wrong with the movie/title (Harley's not a member of the B.o.P.).*****Side note regarding Black Canary: a lot of people thought it was dumb how she fainted after she did her shriek, but you learn she never uses it so it made sense to me; if you bottle up powers as opposed to using them all the time, it could affect you more.**********Side note regarding Harley: another thing people thought was dumb was Harley using non-lethal rounds at the police station, but (A.) she's not a completely horrible person (villain) and (B.) she was there to break someone out NOT slaughter a bunch of cops!?*****In summary, if you like Deadpool and/or Suicide Squad (and you're okay with female-led movies that aren't necessarily "feminist"), you'll probably like this movie. Is it a movie you watch for plot (Batman V. Superman: Dawn of Justice, The Dark Knight trilogy, Watchmen, etc.) no, but it's VERY entertaining!PS - the missing, unaccounted for .25 star is for the SUBTLE agendas the movie has buried beneath the surface; it they were more blatant, this review would be A LOT different!
BoP is just a genuinely fun time with a unique style. It runs at a breezy pace with a diverse cast of distinctive and interesting characters. The movie is an interesting mixture of live-action cartoon, spaghetti western, crime saga, and more flamboyant superhero flick. I must especially stress the crime saga aspect. What separates this from a lot of other superhero films is the emphasis on the multiple interconnected storylines that all mesh together at the end.Director Cathy Yan brings a unique style to the whole thing. Pacing is tight. Music is good. The costumes and sets have this fascinating combo of bright seventies/eighties pop and the inner city and the criminal world. Seriously, I don't think I've ever seen anything quite like this.Margot Robbie does an excellent job as Harley. Though her Brooklyn accent never sounds quite convincing, she appears to be having a ball. The entire cast is good and I just don't have enough time to mention them all.Admittedly, this is a very lightweight film. Even the comedic Deadpool movies had more of a stronger emotional backbone for the characters. To clarify, this shouldn't be put on the same level of lightweight superhero films of old, specifically Batman Forever or Batman and Robin. Effort is put into building this world.And yeah, what everyone else has been saying is true. There aren't a lot of Birds of Prey in this Birds of Prey movie. Though all the BoP members have their moments to shine, this is a Harley Quinn movie. This kind of feels like a backdoor pilot for the superhero team. I'm especially disappointed we didn't get more time with Huntress (Cloverfield Lane and Fargo season 3's Mary Elizabeth Winstead) who gets the least amount of screentime.It's also true that fans of the BoP comics may be disappointed in certain changes from them. In particular, Cassandra Cain (Ella Jay Baso) who originally was an assassin trained from birth and one-time Batgirl is now a sterotypical streetwise latchkey kid.Just a heads up that though this R-rated movie is trying to have fun and may not be super dark like the recent Joker there are a couple moments that may be a bit much for some. The villains Black Mask (Ewan McGregor) and Victor Zsaz (Chris Messina) do a few pretty messed up things in this. Though I don't think any comic book movie in recent memory has done such a good job of making you hate the villains.Overall, I can't say this is the most substantive superhero film, but it's such a joy to watch.






Many people write about this movie saying it's lacking. I get why they say that but i just want to say that the movie is excellent, the fight scenes in the movie are really well coreographed with snappy movement following the music. I would say that the last third is the best part of the movie and i wish they would focus on that part a little bit more. It's a DC movie and as most newer dc movies it has a excellent soundtrack every song being catchy and every song fits with the tone of the movie. The movie dosn't take itself to serously witch is good because it's a comic book movie and shouldn't take itself to seriously. The ony thing i could wish this movie was is that i wish it was longer, i really liked it and hope that Warner Brothers keep it up. First the joker movie now this? Excellent job guys and gals keep it up!






Birds of Prey is being overpraised by many critics. Some of it is fun, while quite a bit is annoying. The movie's script and story aren't particularly special either. Birds of Prey is better than Suicide Squad, but so are a lot of movies. It's an aright time waster, but I didn't care much for the characters. Margot Robbie is a good actress however, I am already tired of her portrayal of Harley Quinn and the action scenes are nothing new. Stay after the credits because that's the funniest thing in the movie.






Watched the movie today, I absolutely love the storyline. Though it's more of a funny action movie, there are some scenes that make you wanna look away. I reccommend this movie to any dc fan. Amazing movie






As someone who grey up loving Harley Quinn from the Batman Animated Series the most, this movie felt like a love letter to me. It reminds me of Tank Girl in its sheer unapologetic girly badassness. From the villains to the action scenes, nothing about it feels generic or boring. Best of all, instead of a generifc, perfect Strong Feminist Role Model who is nearly robotic in her perfection, Harley's a fun mess who screws up, loses, can be a horrible person, and is just so delightfully human. Honestly can't remember when last I enjoyed a superhero(ish) movie this much.






The movie is quite good but I wish it was a bit longer. Costumes were not good but all in all I give 8/10 based upon the work of Cathy, Chad and efforts of all the starcast especially Margot Robbie. Most of the jokes were shown in trailer which was obvious to guess, well can't help.
Anyhow, movie is worth a watch probably don't go for expensive experience. Movie is fine to watch in cinemas or can be watched a t home as well.
Loved the work and DC characters, I want to see more of this.






The first half felt all over the place, but it finds its footing. Not a phenomenal movie by any strech, but does plenty good to make it a fun and enjoyable ride.






I was thinking this could be really bad but it actually was quite good. It's not a film for memorable, serious and class characters but it's actually pretty hilarious!Black mask was pretty good but not sure why him a Victor were together.Black Canary was miles behind the quality of the CW TV show canaries but she fits in with this type of film well.The rest of the characters were pretty good and I'll give this an 8 out of 10.






No doubt For Greatnesses of Margot Robbie performance, Nice Music, a lot of fun,Messy Time Jumping, and Over Feminisms.
It's above The Average, To much better than Suicide Squad.
And for who said it's Bad movie , Guys it's just entertainment movie Nothing more.






Finally Warner/DC gave the opportunity to their directors be full creative, as they're not worried about the the R rating. That's good and seems to be one of the ingredients to create new awesome (and different) movies.
Birds of Prey is really creative, the clothes, scenarios and cinematography are incredible; Margot Robbie gives her best as Harley Quinn; the action sequences are simple and very well choreographed (showing how sometimes a blockbuster doesn't need to have big explosions, cities in danger, or colossal spaceships to be awesome).
It's everything good, except the script and the editing. The first is more of the same and give us a story that doesn't have anything new, neither has a plot twist, is really predictable and sometimes can be just a little boring. The second tries to be original, looking fresh and but unfortunately sometimes the way that Birds of Prey is edited doesn't fix well in the main story.It's not bad, to be honest Warner Bros gave us a nice movie with some fresh concepts. However the plot isn't interesting at all and that's the biggest enemy of Birds of Prey. But, being optimistic, I think the DC Universe is going in a good way.For me is just a 6/10






Birds of prey is better than joker and dark knight. I think this is the best dc movie.






A colourful , quirky and entertaining feminist punch that's best served with the tangy flavour of dark humour.
Basically , a good popcorn flick!






Entering the theater, lots of kids around, this doesn't looks promising, isn't Harley Quinn supposed to be a badass and naughty character, violences and adult scenes should be the main theme of the movie, but the movie is exactly what it's look like, whimsical effort to create loveable characters in a very messy and unattractive storyline. Though there are some highlights in the movie but overally it could be much better if they didn't try so hard to make a movie reachable for larger audience.






This movie was better than I expected. Cinematography was amazing,the Action sequences were over the top at times but still enjoyable, the music was cool and the best part was Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn,she nailed that role and it was really great to see that character in the big screen again. Evan McGregor was also amazing. The other characters were interesting and had an ample amount of screen time. The plot was just okish though and they haven't utilized their R rating much. It's still not the best of DCEU but, it was one hell of a ride although it was short scaled. Better than suicide squad.I recommend this movie for all Harley Quinn fans and hardcore DC fans. Those who are looking for a Joker type movie,stay home.7/10






I expected a lot from this film after reading the reviews and was let down. The only thing that is good about this movie is Margot Robbies performance.






Cast, AMAZING, Music, AMAZING. Holy crap it's so funny we were trying to not burst out cry laugh in the theater. Totally gonna go see it a second time.






This is the PERFECT Harley Quinn movie. My fanboy dream come true. It felt like a Harley Quinn comic book come to life. Not only that but if you've been watching Harley Quinn's new animated show it was like a live action version of this. Stylish, funny, quirky, witty and of course crazy. Originally when the teaser came out for Birds Of Prey I wasn't as obsessed with Harley Quinn or comics as I used to be and I didn't care as much. Let's just say with each new trailer i slowly got back into Harley and comics and I was very excited for this movie. However through marketing I felt like it's the perfect movie for Harley Quinn stans but disappointing for Birds Of Prey stans. This is because the movie only has 2 actual members of Birds Of Prey members. Harley was never related to Birds Of Prey yet is the main character of this movie. I thought it would be the perfect movie for me as a Harley stan but the bop stan in me had mixed feelings. Seeing the movie now i don't really care about this now and I think they work well together and I think all aspects are perfectly well done as well as the Birds. A lot of people say they wish Huntress had more screen time and I think I can agree with this I just didn't really notice. This movie is very stylistic and fun, with the editing, pop up text, camera work, soundtrack, everything is just so amazing. The action is always so fun in every scene. Margot really embodied Harley in this movie to the max and it made me so happy to see her truly shine! I also have to say I loved Black Mask and Victor Zsasz being the main villains as they are lesser known which I always enjoy more than popular characters. This is a new campy funny take on Black Mask while still being dark and twisted and Ewan McGregor may be the DCEU's best villain. I really hope the movie does well so we can get Gotham City Sirens next. Not only is this my fave DC movie but will become one of my fave movies ever and I'm already eager to rewatch it. I might even go see it in cinema again! Which I never do! I would honestly rate it 10/10 because I found ZERO flaws in the movie genuinely. Everything is so perfect about it and it truly was a comic book brought to life!






AND I LOVED IT. Yes, I know how to put my political views aside and judge a film for what it is. It's a movie with a lot more brain than you think and it is MUCH more original than a lot of what dc has made from their universe. Way better than suicide squad and a film that took its time. With the less than a 85 million budget this film REALLY gives it everything it has. Definitely recommend and I had fun. Had some issues and it's not perfect, but the flaws actually benefit the movie in a weird way.






I thought this movie saved the disaster we call suicide squad or in fact, how Leto destroyed the dc universe. Robbie is the perfect Harley Quinn. Her costumes, her fight moves, and that anti-hero vibe is perfect. It's great they didn't turn her into a hero. Canary was probably my second favorite. It was great to see that they didn't over use her scream. Great character development. This was overall, just a fun movie and was absolutely hilarious. Wonderful to see the dc universe is killing it since aquaman!
Much better than expected. Great girl power movie. I was really wondering how this movie would be with Harley being the main focus but it was nicely put together






I saw some comments about Margot, that she doesn't fit in that role, but guys she is the one who should be playing it, because she has all the emotions, acting skills, looks, which Harley Quinn must have so stop criticizing her she deserves that role!! And for the movie I think it's cool and fun and amazing to watch because all the girls did their maximum and you can easily say that after watching it so stop wasting time in reading comments and watch the movie, you will enjoy it.Also I think it would be better if we had Harley and Joker movie before this one because it would be interesting to watch why they broke up and what joker did to Harley.






Don't listen to the trolls or fanboys who made up their minds about this movie months ago. Go see it yourself and make up your own mind! Having said that...I really enjoyed this movie. I thought that the action in this movie was executed very well and the color palette was used to its full potential. I love that DC is shifting away from trying to be a carbon copy of the MCU and is now focused on being the alternative. Hard R. Villain-centric. Letting their directors put their own stamp on every movie.Margot Robbie cements herself as the Harley Quinn of this generation. She's funny, vicious and walks the anti-hero line with grace. Ewen McGregor chews up every scene that he's in. A pure adaptation of Black Mask? Nah. An entertaining take on the character? You betcha. The cast top to bottom is great and I hope we get the chance for a follow-up in the future.Some of the storytelling is messy. There's an abundance of narration that sometimes works but other times feels like a shot of nitro to revealing exposition. The timeline jumps around a bit but telling this story linearly would take away its iniquity and make it feel like every other comic book movie.Overall, I give it an 8 but I bumped it up to 9 to counter the trolls trying to trash this movie for not being the movie that makes them feel better about themselves.






Great movie! it was very entertaining and exciting to watch, definitely worth watching!! also Margot was amazing :)






Dceu movies need to do this going straight forword .give director's freedom let them do what they want to do.paty Jenkins ,James wan ,Shazam director Todd Phillips and now Cathy yan .i love how everyone is hating on this movie because it's woman beating men up I'm a man i don't see anything wrong with this one it's a Saturday morning cartoon on big screen with Harley's perspective .it's tonaly different so are all the dceu movies that's what is different then Marvel .the future is bright.






I was very happy with this movie. It made me laugh and had some great action set pieces. It was different from other superheroes movie in terms of story structure and tone, which was a good thing. Ignore the trolls and go see this movie!






Birds of prey is better than suicide squad, but it's just okay...... I think this movie could've been made better. But I felt much better than suicide squad anyway, and this one is okay but not good






If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Since Wonder Woman that the DCEU has not missed a beat. Even though the latter is still my favorite of the universe, I have mostly a positive opinion about Justice League, Aquaman, and Shazam! Yes, these are not the greatest comic-book movies of all-time, but I would be lying if I denied that I was entertained. Birds of Prey follows the same path: it's fun, action-heavy, and it boasts a phenomenal cast. It has some issues regarding the actual plot and a few characters, but I'll get there.First of all, let me get the mandatory compliments to Margot Robbie's performance out of the way. If there's a DC character better than Harley Quinn for Robbie to portray, please let me know, because I think she's absolutely perfect as a lunatic, over-the-top psychiatrist-turned-psychopath. Suicide Squad might be a total mess, but I doubt anyone denies how Robbie fits seamlessly into the Harley persona. From her looks to the way she speaks and from her physical movement to her facial expressions, there's just no better casting.She embodies the whole film's chaotic vibe and even contributes to the (very) colorful set design. However, she's not the only one who delivers a spectacular performance. Jurnee Smollett-Bell offers a surprisingly captivating display as Dinah Lance / Black Canary. Even though Harley Quinn is the main character, I found myself caring a lot about Dinah. Her way of living suits the character's personality like a glove, and she's undoubtedly the best-written secondary character of the movie. Unfortunately, I can't say the same about the others, and this is one of my biggest issues.It's a film packed with cliches and attempts of making the characters aware of those cliches, which is also, well, something pretty overused. What's more generic? Having the bad guy telling the hero their masterplan or having the hero stating how the bad guy is incredibly dumb by thinking of doing that? At first, I laughed, and I thought it was funny the way Christina Hodson was avoiding to write straight-up cliche characters by making everyone else aware of the way these talk or move.But the whole "I know you're cliche, so you can get away with saying or doing cliche things" only works for a couple of scenes, not an entire movie. This is why I wasn't able to connect with Renee Montoya or care about her narrative at all. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is one of my favorite actresses, but she has the least screentime of the entire cast. I never criticize a film for not giving an actor/actress I like a more important role (unlike other people, I believe it would be unfair to do so). Still, I do complain if I think a particular character should have been given more screentime, which is the case of Huntress.I find her backstory way more exciting and emotionally investing than Rosie Perez's character, but sadly Huntress' personal story serves only as a not-that-surprising third act twist. There are several past-present transitions in the storytelling, most work, but some feel extremely abrupt. Nevertheless, Winstead is outstanding every single time she's on camera! Ewan Mcgregor offers a good performance as the villain, but he leads me to my other major issue: the central plot. Trivia time: a MacGuffin is an object, device, or event necessary to the narrative and the motivation of the characters, but insignificant, unimportant, or irrelevant in itself.The thread that connects every single character is based on one of the most overused MacGuffins ever. Now, don't get me wrong: a MacGuffin is NOT a synonym of bad writing or of a bad plot! It's merely something that leads to nothing. Having in mind that Birds of Prey is a character-driven movie, a plot centered around a MacGuffin is not unusual. As long as every character works, the primary story can simply be a passenger (Quentin Tarantino's Once Upon a Time in Hollywood applies this method). However, in Birds of Prey, not every character has an interesting story...Basically, Christina Hodson's screenplay isn't exactly bad, but it isn't great too. Just like the film, it has its ups and downs, and I saved some of the ups for last because I do want to end this review on a positive note. Finally, a DCEU movie where the action isn't overwhelmed with CGI, but with detailed choreography and long takes instead! Thank you, Cathy Yan, for bringing some of the best action sequences in this universe. Even if the third act gets a little sloppy due to the amount of characters, it's still a very satisfying ending. The score beautifully accompanies the action, and the visuals are truly gorgeous to look at. The comedy bits are on-point, I laughed quite often, but my final remark goes to a topic I rarely address...Birds of Prey is a filmmaking lesson on how to produce an incredibly diverse movie without it feeling forced or unnatural. Only AFTER leaving the theater, I acknowledged the fact that the cast and characters are from various races, cultures, and have different sexual preferences. Why? Because this film doesn't waste its runtime by having its characters mention how black, white, Latinas, Chinese, gay, or whatever they are. They simply are what they are, and we all have eyes to see them. Congrats to Yan, Hodson, and everyone else who decided to treat the characters as if they're humans like every one of us.In the end, Birds of Prey (and the ridiculously long subtitle) continues DCEU's streak of (at least) good movies since Wonder Woman came out. With a phenomenal cast led by an outstanding Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn, Cathy Yan delivers some of the best action of the entire universe in a genuinely entertaining superhero flick. A colorful, chaotic, and fun vibe is present throughout the whole runtime, as well as a pretty neat score. However, Christina Hodson's screenplay lacks creativity. The main plot revolves around the most overused MacGuffin ever, and some characters are straight-up taken from the book of cliches. It's a generic comic-book film with a formulaic narrative, but one that possesses enough fun and entertainment to overlook the typical story.Rating: B-






Saw Birds of Prey yesterday and absolutely LOVED it. Cathy Yan's team-up with 87Eleven resulted in beautifully choreographed fighting scenes with catastrophic consequences for the poor unfortunate souls who dared take on Harley Quinn and her band of merry women.Had my doubts about Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Huntress in the beginning, but seeing her practice her introduction in front of the mirror to sound like a true menacing vigilante only for it to come to a wonderfully anticlimactic and utterly satisfying reveal in the movie's third act convinced me of her prowess as Huntress.Jurnee Smollet-Bell is completely beguiling and sexy as hell as Canary. The way her powers are constantly alluded to, yet never quite revealed until the third act really cemented my love for her as an accomplished fighter first and meta human second. Sidenote - and I fully agree with Huntress's comment - the way she can kick ass in those skin tight jeans... Mamma mia.Detective "I shaved my balls for this?" Montoya is another delightful addition to this cast of misfit women. Not only am I crazy about her accent, but her gun-toting, whisky-slamming ways have found their way into my heart.Last but not least, Margot Robbie. What an absolute champion. From her undying love of Bruce - after that hunky Wayne guy - to the literal frenzy she gets into for that eggs and bacon sandwich from Sal... She is the new Clown Queen of Gotham if you ask me, come to rightfully claim her throne from her ex-boyfriend.In conclusion: do NOT sit on this movie. I can't remember the last time I laughed this hard out loud in the theatre or felt such empathy whenever a guy was brutally beaten up by a girl (Harley has a proclivity for cracking balls and smashing kneecaps' beware).






This movie feels like Warner Bros' attempt to amend the mistakes they did with Suicide Squad. Hell, at some point it felt like the scenes came from a Suicide Squad movie. The question is, does it work? Yes and no.What this movie has and Suicide Squad lacked is that all the casts are great. Margot Robbie is having the time of her life playing Harley Quinn, Rosie Perez was brilliant and funny, Mary Elizabeth Winstead is so good she should have way more screen time, Jurnee Smollet-Bell shuts her critics down with definitive performance of Black Canary (Oh and that scene was great and was so badass), and Ella Jay Basco was the heart of the movie. And don't forget the charismatic Ewan McGregor who is the embodiment of Roman Sionis (at least from what I have seen from the Arkham games and DCAU movies). The interactions between the main characters are the reason why this movie didn't suck. It was the only thing that worked but it worked so well.Other than that, this movie felt like you're watching a Suicide Squad movie for the 2nd time apart from the fact BoP had a decent third act. I don't know why they inserted a song in every scene possible. Probably to make the scenes more badass but it definitely didn't. Why would you do that? It's like you're watching a never-ending musical video at times.All in all, the movie was a good fun but it could and should have been better.






Awesome fight scenes , powerful and flawed women, humor and gore with a splash of insanity. Nothing was better than seeing this movie and i MEAN NOTHING! You are in for a vulgar wild ride that is true to the comic books with our Harley Quinn ! A must watch for anyone who is fun !






Gonna give this movie an 9 just because there are so many bitter men rating the movie badly because MUH FEMINISM. Grow up people , grow up.The movie itself is okay, Margot Robbie rocks as always . While not very interesting plot wise , there were many cool looking fights and funny dialogue. Also visually movie also looks great.






All i can say is the all lead female cast is great and most men are probably giving bad reviews because they are salty with it being a movie about powerful women. 10/10 I'll even go see it again!






To say films based on DC Comics have been all over the place over the last few years would be an understatement. Yes, they seem to have found their footing with films like Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Shazam!, and they even have a new series of Batman films on the way, but were these just a fluke? No, Birds of Prey: And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn (a title that I'll only write in full once during this review) absolutely continues their streak of quality content for this genre, even though there were quite a few missed opportunities. Here's why this film is a blast to watch, even with its faults.Picking up after the events of Suicide Squad, but also kind of throwing away everything that happened in it, Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) finds herself broken off from the Joker and on her own for the first time in a while. Becoming involved with a young girl who gets her hands on a diamond that evil villain Roman Sionis will do anything to retrieve, she finds herself a new friend. The first two acts of this film, however, are really just a set-up for a new crew for her to join. The third act of this movie is fantastic, which brings me to my biggest complaint.This film is called Birds of Prey, but the actual team that the title is referring to doesn't form until the film's third act, which was a real bummer. The majority of this movie is all about Harley Quinn, which is fine because Margot Robbie is terrific as this character, but this movie felt like too much of a good thing at times. She was easily the best part about Suicide Squad, but I now believe she works best in an ensemble. Her performance here is great, but she needed more people to play off of. This is the reason the end of this film is so great, which also made the rest of the movie slightly hollow for me.Switching back over to the positive side, which this movie has much more of than negatives, I would be remiss if I didn't mention Ewan McGregor as Roman Sionis. This performance made the movie for me. Yes, Jurnee Smollett-Bell and Mary Elizabeth Winstead are great supporting actresses and I really hope they further their stories in future films, but McGregor is probably the most memorable part to me. His hammy performance had me laughing on multiple occasions. If this was the second film in the Birds of Prey series and he was the only villain, playing off this group of women, it probably would've been one of the best comic book movies to date, but these elements weren't utilized together enough for me.In the end, Birds of Prey is undeniably a lot of fun. Margot Robbie is wonderful once again, Smollet-Bell and Winstead steal the show in a few instances (which I wanted more of), and Cathy Yan does a terrific job helming as director. Being her first big film, I'm very impressed with her work here and I hope she gets to do a sequel to this because I will gladly spend another two hours with these characters. While not everything in this movie worked for me, quite a bit of it did, especially the third act, which has the perfect location to take place in. I really enjoyed watching Birds of Prey, even though I didn't think it was perfect.






Cocaine gives her powers & she killed a guy because he voted for Bernie Sanders. What's not to love about that? It just made me love her character THAT much more lol. GO WATCH THE MOVIE!! I would have gave it a 10 but the little girl character, her horrible acting didn't fit into the movie.
Mostly.
The acting, writing, directing and production was all done very well.
But it still has a fair amount of feminist ideology thrown in, but done in a way to serve the story as opposed to ramming down our throats or being to femine for me to enjoy.At its heart is crime movie in Gotham, it does not stray far from that and is not a turn off your brain over the top action movie. It has depth, well crafted violence and humour. Well worth a watch.Even though Cassie was not portrayed as I would like as her as Batgirl was amazing.Amanda Conner and Chuck Dixon got nods in the credits too.






The fight scenes are good, but not too epic. The ending is pretty predictable. But the development character of Harley Quinn is really good, althought it is too prominent for Birds of Prey movie. Plus, the action for the Birds of Prey is too little.






I don't expect much from comic book movies these days, I just hope to at least not be bored, and pleasantly surprised if it's a genuinely good movie. This was entertaining and fun, with a lot of good moments, but the script being a little too all over the place and needing some doctoring stopped it from being a solid win. Yes, I had a great time and got my money's worth...I just saw its potential and could see that the studio dropped the ball where they invest multitudes of time, money, and marketing into their male-led counter parts...yet, many of those still end up being steaming piles of hot garbage.Of the new DC universe, this is one of the better ones. The action sequences were solid and had some really good moments in a genre that has become very been-there-done-that, with little fresh to add. I really enjoyed Harley's action scene with the bat. That was solid. Margot Robbie was excellent. I really liked her character in Suicide Squad and her acting, performance, and fight scenes were great. Frankly, after seeing this, women are better at action scenes. Their bodies can handle the acrobatics better and make it look more effortless and cool. Kind of like Ben Affleck in the bat suit looking ridiculous and all I can think is this is impossible for him to move under all that massive weight. There's a reason Asian men dominate in action and as action doubles, because their lean frames are perfect for action, just like the female frame is, which is why Gal Gadot and now Margot Robbie look great in those scenes. Marvel and DC should use this to their advantage rather than always sidelining the women. Sure, big dudes punching things has their place but trying to constantly push that these guys who don't have the frames for it are gymnastic or kung fu experts is ridiculous. And for all the men screaming at the computer that women can't fight and it's unrealistic, just remember that MMA cage matches always used to be won by the tiny dudes using jiu-jitsu, bringing down, giant, more impressive looking men. Or the true stories of elderly Filipino men in San Fransisco beating the crap out of multiple gang members with a walking cane as their kali stick.I also loved the Cassandra Cain character. She was a great sidekick to Harley. She was very endearing and did a good job as far as acting. I wish they could have brought the women together sooner as I wanted to know more about Huntress, and Canary wasn't given enough meat to her character in the time she's on screen. I thought they were a great team and I wish the script could have been more focused on them and less about Black Mask, which, frankly, Ewan was a bit overplayed for me. He was trying too hard to be Joker. He wasn't terrible, but he was a bit distracting and not a good enough villain to match Harley. And I hated Zsasz. I just could not picture that actor as a villain. He wanted to be that guy so much, all I can see is Mindy Project. He overcompensated and his character just didn't fit the film.The directing was decent and the script was okay. Not bad, it just could have used some help to tighten it up. I feel Cathy Yan has a good future, as the film was pretty good for a newbie. I've seen other female directors advanced to fill the gap who are not quite there yet like Susanna Fogel and Greta Gerwig. Please, I'm not buying all the Gerwig hype, and I enjoyed Birds of Prey far more than Little Women. The style Cathy Yan presented was great. I loved the animated intro and the motion graphics throughout the film. It made it a lot of fun and her style of using animation, slo-mo bits, was overall fresh and fun, and complimented Harley's erratic personality. It had elements of Baz Luhrmann, but not quite as consistent as Baz, but I'm comparing to Romeo and Juliet, where, Baz had a lot more time to craft his skills at that point, and Cathy is a newer director.While Birds of Prey will not go down in history it was a lot of fun and I would watch a sequel. And despite all the men crying about the injustice on IMDB of this film daring to exist, it is on par with the multitudes of comic book films they are under the delusion are works of art. With some polishing and tightening up the script, Birds of Prey could be DC's answer to Deadpool






Margot Robbie you beauty!! She was amazing in portraying her character of psychotic Harley Quinn. The movie is particularly emphasising on her character and other characters like Huntress, Renee Montoya, Black Canary are not given enough screen space and importance (Black Canary used her super power - Canary Cry only once in the entire movie which is also seen n the trailer). Story line is not that interesting, however action is too good and music is awesome. Margot Robbie will keep glued to the screen...






Dont listen to the terrible reviews this film is easy watching good fun colourful and quirky.It's not 10/10 but s great watch and worth seeing.Funny and quirky!






Absolutely brilliant movie. It's nice to get a inside of Harley Quinn mind.Basically the movie is about after Harleys relationship with the joker.Well done DC.






I found this movie fun and entertaining!
I am not sure why so many are saying it was boring?
It is not a deep and meaningful matrix mind blower in any means, its just a fun and colorful Harley Quinn movie!
So many say it would be better if the movie was about "this" or "that. It had to be about something and that something was quite entertaining!I would suggest just go see it and make your own mind up!






Birds of prey was 10 times better the Sucide squad much more funny and the action scene were better put together.






SYNOPSIS:
Word is out that Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) and The Joker broke up and that opens up a full-out manhunt for Quinn. She offers to retrieve a special diamond for Roman Sionis (Ewan McGregor) in exchange for her safety as things get chaotic.REVIEW:
This movie impressed me a lot. Following a not-so-great, but slowly rejuvenating DC streak and a couple of unimpressive trailers, I went into this movie expecting to disappoint and quite the contrary.
POSITIVES:
I know it's no surprise, but Ewan McGregor and Margot Robbie were phenomenal. I mean Oscar like performances. I understand it's early and it's a comic book movie with comic book characters, but for me I was completely locked in with these characters and watching the movie I was just admiring the performances. Cathy Yan really directed this well. The shots were so beautiful and it felt like a real, dark world that I was immersed in. I knew it was going to have very cool color schemes from the trailer and it really enhanced some of the shots and helped build not just Gotham, but more so Harley's world. Very well done.
NEGATIVES:
Not all of the acting was on point and an entire police station sequence that was a really far stretch. I know it's a comic book movie, but the writing could've been slightly more clever there and the choreo really felt like choreo. Possibly due to time constraints, the fighting felt under-rehearsed. However, there were some very cool video-game-like combinations.
CONCLUSION:
This is a very fun movie that I think anyone would like. It is rated-R and unlike a lot of people, I do believe in most cases it adds something to be rated-R. It ends up being more realistic to me which helps me to fully lick myself in. I do wish it didn't feel like a "How To flip a guy behind your back" video, as much as a very polished choreo performance like the John Wick films. All-in-all a very fun movie that I can definitely see myself seeing again. Following Aquaman and Shazam, I think DC is taking steps in the right direction. 7.5/10.






For most I enjoyed this crazy ride and the best part about it is Margot Robbie playing the insane Harley Quinn.
The positive and negatives are the same thing, the action.
I found myself a little entertained and slightly bored towards the back end of the film.
Still it's what we wanted for the Harley Quinn character.






After my friend portrayed The Joker in a parody video I've been joking around that we had to go see what his ex was up to. Considering that the last time we saw Harley Quinn was in the 'fondly' remembered "Suicide Squad", neither one of us were that exited to see this. Which is why I'm happy to say that I feel fairly optimistic going out of this once. DC has been doing a lot better in the last year. After "Justice League" wasn't what is was supposed to be the creative team at Warner Brothers was re-arranged. Which turned out 'fantabulous'. Since then we've gotten a lot more creative movies where they let the filmmakers really thrive and do their own thing with stories with different personalities. For example, I never expected to really like "Shazam!". The reason? Well, it had heart.It was good that the Birds of Prey are going up against a villain operating on a grounded level. To me It always felt weird that Harley was fighting the Enchantress' army with a baseball bat. Roman Sionis (Black Mask) is a crime lord and a psychopath. A perfect threat for Harley and her friends. You also get a good sense of why she's good at fighting. She's got a strong intuition of things and impressive acrobatic skills. All showcased gallantly with the focused fight scenes. That was an awesome surprise! The narrative is at its strongest when it's concentrated on Harley's mindset and perspective. There's an endearing side to her. She's not just completely a villain. There's a limit she won't cross. Her interactions with the kid Cassandra offers us an insight to her emotional side. Maybe there was an innocent youth that was robbed from her? Perhaps due to The Joker? There are times when you need a movie that's fun and plays around with structure or narrative. You can take it as jarring in a few places because the story can jump around. Didn't bother me since it goes well in hand with the unreliable narrator gimmick. The movie kept me locked in. Although some of the supporting characters didn't have enough gravitas for me to get latched on to their stories. Harley is the one who really steals the show. She's the character you'll see the world from the most and therefore care for the most. A solid "Good Time" flick. I was so happy to have been able to enjoy another DC movie with my friends.






It was definitely fun. More of a Harley solo movie. Had some corny cliche plot with one of Gotham's more menacing villains being really boring and annoying. Ewan was all wrong for this role. He was barely Black Mask at all. For like a few minutes in this film. The Harley fights were cool but too frequent in the first act. Spread it out. The third act seemed a bit abrupt and ended too quickly with some seriously corny dialogue in the diner. Worth watching at least once in theatre for me. Huge Harley fan.






The movie was good but I expected more. Little cartoonish in some since like the attack on the police station.. but the second half of the film was better..I loved the Huntress character more than Harley. I hope if the will do part 2 ...they do it better and with stronger director






Director Cathy Yan packs Birds of Prey full of colorful energy and creative action. Its fight choreography separates it from the more drab comic book movie fare, and it has legitimately funny moments. However, with its foot firmly on the pedal, it too often races ahead into cringeworthy humor and extraneous exposition. Birds of Prey hopes the sugar rush does not wear off until the credits roll, and for the most part it succeeds. However, it is impossible not to notice the bloat.






I loved every minute of this movie and the soundtrack was amazing






One of the most bonkers films I've seen loved it though






Childish movie weak story and senario bad screenplay harley quin character presnt as very silly character ..my rating is more than this movie deserve margot robbey is pretty actress but her acting as harley quin was bad
The charcter look very ridiculous and superficial ...but on the other hand some scene(very little scene) of harley quinn was funny and her voice was very good for this charcter
Dont expect to see agreat stoy of harley quin if you want to watch atrue harley quinn charcter go and play batman arkham city






Birds of Prey feels like what Suicide Squad should have been. It's a Harley Quinn solo film, but dressed up as an ensemble piece, and with that it works becasue it focuses on the most interesting and fun character. The movie has some good visuals and stylish action to keep the viewer hooked, and there's a much better (and more subtle) use of music here than there was in Suicide Squad.It's not perfect though. Ewan McGregor is awful here as he hams it up in a very one dimensional performance, and the rest of the cast are quite forgettable. The narrative is choppy and sometimes I was confused as to just where I was in the film.As for the accusations of misandry and man hating, well yes there's no denying that there is a bit of that here. Almost every bad person in the movie is male, and most of them are portrayed as rapey and unfeeling pieces of s-h-i-t. It does sort of justify the violence against them, but it's a bit of a bad generalisation of men too.Still, Margot Robbie is thoroughly entertaining in the lead, but it would have been nicer if the film around her was a bit more coherent and less gimmicky.






Frenetic action and humor compete with disjointed storytelling and lackluster performances.
Margo Robbie does a great job of showing depth and multiple facets of a woman scorned with a screw loose. Ella Jay Basco came out pretty strong for her first feature film role. Kurnee Smollett-Bell gave a believable performance and became a likeable character for me. Ewan McGregor was a little over the top, as would be expected for a DC villain. There were some humorous moments, mainly slapstick with a small amount of witty banter.
Character development seemed like an afterthought. The story arc was confusing. Rosie Perez's character was extremely clichéd, but this almost seemed like a tongue in cheek, self aware gag. Mary Elizabeth Winstead's performance was flat and forgettable. Chris Messina was nowhere near the mark for his character, and left me confused and disappointed.






The script needed 2 or 3 more edits before being released. In my opinion, Harley Quinn's character stands out when she is bantering with her "new friends" the viewer can feel the chemistry, but that happens just in the last bit of the movie. Another pro is the villain, Ewan McGregor gives such a great performance. Sadly there are missed opportunities in the tonal shifts of the movie from the first to the third acts, the men hating women portrayal that is just so in your face, and the resolution of the villain which felt anticlimactic. Also, the crew could have benefited from more screen time together. 1st 1/10 2nd 2/10 3rd 6/10. Total 3/10.
Not as bad as suicide squad, but not as refreshing as Wonder Woman.






I had a good time and it was lots of fun. Not everything needs to be deep and gritty. Sometimes it just needs to be enjoyable:)






Not as bad as everyone's making out. Fun movie with some comical moments and tons of action. I still haven't seen suicide squad so didn't have anything to compare but my 16 year old son and I enjoyed this movie. One tip, don't wait the extra 10 minutes for the credits to finish for the "surprise" at the end, it's not worth it.






It's a nice movie. Action is also good. Just a bit dragged here and there but overall it's surely a one time watch !






It's ok, i love Harley PoV it's fun and she take a lot of inspiration from de comic books and i love it but it didn't feel like a Birds of Prey movie is more like Harley Quinn movie and i didn't like it when Harley narratens the other characters lives is really cringe and is too much exposition dialoge and it does't feel natural. My favourite secondary characters is Black Canary because is the only one whose life is not entirely narrate by Harley, it's more more subtle so you can understand her by actions, i didn't like what they done with Cassandra Cain i whis they had given her another name. in short, I wish this would have been a Harley Quinn movie and her emancipation focusing on it and we would watch the rest of the characters through the interaction with Harley and reserve the Birds of Prey team up for sequel delving into these characters (Black Canary, Huntress and Renee) because here they feel so secondary... the name of the movie is in the epilogue mentioned in the worst possible way, narrated quickly by Harley.






A smallish spin on a classic heist film with great art direction and fight choreography. The editing was a great pace to fit Harley's personality and for once it uses a full female protagonist group without feeling cringey or preachy. It has its flaws too though: the antagonist is badly written and most characters fall flat too with unfinished arcs. Still a fun and colourful movie.






When I first saw the trailer I didn't know if I would like it but this movie surprised me. When I watched it I enjoyed it more than I thought at first I definitely would recommend it!






Full of amazing and violent fighting scenes! The choreography for those fighting scene are bloody cool!
Soundtrack is really on the point! Margot is born for this role! A good piece of an entertaining antihero movie! And, oh boy..that hyena! The movie deliveres exactly what you expected from this kind of movie! Not one second of boring! Ignore the low ratings rewiers! Those are clearly marvel girls and marvel manchilds who hate everything from DC/DCEU! It isnso obviously they are here just to rate this movie 1 star even if they haven't seen the movie! That's why marvel has the most toxic fanbase! And ignore the misogynists and those who cry about this movie being "feministic"! They hate strong women! This is a comic book movie! In comic book movies women are strong as men!






Okay, I apologize in advance if my review is a bit "all over the place", but bear with me and read to the end. So, as a die hard Harley Quinn fan (and one of her toughest critics) I admit I do not think Margot Robbie is the best casting choice for Harley even though I love her as an actress! That being said she did a MUCH better job on the character work in this film than Suicide Squad. Margot definitely had more freedom to be the fun and silly Harley we all know and love, without being objectified.My biggest qualms with the film was that they seemed to haphazardly throw in HQ comic book references without any explanation, which I guess would make them easter eggs? Still, I would have loved to see Harley have a conversation with her taxidermy beaver "Bernie" like in the comics or even extend the roller derby scene since that's such a big part of her life in the books. Also, I'm always down for more blood. Admittedly Huntress' character seemed a bit awkward and flat, but still packed punches of her own.Aside from all that, this movie was so fresh and entertaining! When I wasn't busy laughing off, I was completely captivated by the epic fighting sequences and in awe of the gorgeous imagery that felt like an acid trip or even like seeing the world through Harley's eyes! Not to mention the great soundtrack.I'm still a bit confused how people are saying this movie is racially biased and pushing a feminist agenda because I didn't get that vibe at all. The ones spouting this nonsense must be extremely repelled by women and multiracial people.This movie has its flaws, sure, but I paid money to be entertained and they did not disappoint! We all knew going into this movie that it wasn't going to be the work of art we know "Joker" to be, but a bright and fun exploration of Harley as a character, and anyone who knows Harley's character should have expected exactly what this film has produced. Ignore the bad reviews and go see this film. 10 stars for reminding me why I love movies and making me feel like a kid again! (And to help balance out the pointless 1 star reviews) This film was a really good time!






Dudes who are threatened by this movie are giving themselves away (oooo, self burn - that's rare).Besides addressing the misogynist reviewers (when majority haven't even seen it!), I have to tell you to go see this movie.Robbie is am excellent actress. The emotional depth she brought to Suicide Squad finally comes to fruition as she becomes a fully realised character.Each Bird of Prey team member is given an adequate and satisfying background without feeling like an origin story.The direction is inspired. It's fun. It's a metaphor for Harley's decay and madness. It's touching.Lastly, it's funny and gorgeously violent.I saw a girl in the studio today and I could only joyously envy her watching this and hopefully inspiring her to competently shoot people with glitter bombs.






I've been going through reciews and a lot of them are saying "I could go into detail, but won't" don't believe these reviews they are probably very fake from people who haven't actually seen the movie






Best DC movie I've seen so far. It's funny and not overly depressing. The action sequences are absolutely amazing, I would describe it as the female John Wick. They followed the comics really well to which i greatly appreciate and they made the villian, a proper villain. He was crazy, had a clear motive and all together terrifying. I was almost afraid to talk in the cinema when he was on screen because he presented such a scary aura. I love Margot Robbie and she didn't fail to impress me in this movie! Altogether, the humour and comedy was amazing and the story and fight scenes planned out and executed perfectly!






It was a fun ride with a lot of amazing action,comedy,drama
it was a hell of a ride






Margot robie single handedly rewrites dc films! Gotham felt real the sets are amazing, the acting by the entire cast is great. Best interpretation of the one and only harley quinn on film.






Harley Quinn and the Birds of Prey was a fun movie to watch. Ton of action, lots of wisecracks, and crazy shenanigans from Harley Quinn. It was also great to see Rosie Perez. The other actresses did a fantastic job. Fun kind of goofy violent movie.






The movie was trying to be on the same level as Deadpool but wasn't as good , still a good movie , definitely go watch it , Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn will never disappoint 👍






Just saw a 10:00 showing of this movie, and I don't know about everyone else's experience but our whole theater was laughing and reacting through the entire thing. I got everything I wanted from this - incredible fight scenes that had fun with it, actual villains instead of whatever Leto was doing in suicide squad (and their defeats were just as good!), and of course costumes and makeup that make me want to redo my whole wardrobe. I thought the storytelling was fantastic, and did a great job of telling each character's story and then weaving them all together for a cohesive understanding. My friends and I walked out so excited, and I would go back to see it again in a heartbeat!!
The movie is like it said "Fantabolous" .
Margott Robbie makes it awesome with the help of Mary Elizabeth Winstead and The black mask guy.
It is really entertaining with beautiful action sequence.
Everyone should watch this . A great move by DC.






I had low expectations going into this movie but I really enjoyed it. I thought it would be all men trashing and girl power. It wasn't. It was enjoyable and I loved the fight scenes. The main antagonist was a little lacking towards the end but I felt McGregor really enjoyed creating his character. So, if you are looking for an entertaining action movie with typical Harley humor give it a shot.






Think Deadpool if she were female and had John Wick action. The story is a little crazy and goes back and forth but it makes perfect sense for a Harley Quinn movie. We don't get enough of the birds which is a shame because Black Canary and Huntress could easily lead their own films.The action is different and really keeps you engaged. It's also hilarious in that dry humor kind of way. I personally loved it! I was a little hesitant because of the costumes but the actresses are so sexy even without sexy fits. Don't listen to the men with fragile masculinity. If you liked John Wick and didn't see it for his abs you might also like this. Give it a try!






Scrolling through these reviews it's clear some of y'all can't stand to see a women driven movie. A movie with women leads is all of sudden Hollywood wokeness? Right. It is a great movie, with amazing action sequences and full out entertainment. Do yourself a favor and skip the reviews, it will have you seeing the movie with the completely wrong idea.






This movie is awesome, I was laughing all the time,I really loved performance of Harley and Huntress, greaj job DC






I'd give it an 8 but put 10 to boost the star average! I thought it was fun and entertaining. As long as you don't get hung up on character canon and just take it for what it is, you'll like it. Margot was awesome and I'll definitely watch it again when it's out for steaming.






It had every emotion. The movie was colorful, exciting, drama, action and fun!!! And you really do connect with Harley character.






Why so much hate? It's Harley Quinn for God's sake.. What were you all thinking guys? Another joker movie where Harley Quinn is just going to be his side kick? Harley Quinn character has got so much potential than just being someone's sidekick.Also if there was Batman, we wouldn't have got to see Gotham City like this, we wouldn't have had this much fun cause again Batman is a super hero whom we all have seen and known for so many years. This is a group independent strong female gang. I really never had this much fun watching a film although I am a film addict and I go to the theaters often.This film basically tells us to quit a toxic relationship with a toxic person. It also has a very catchy sandtrack. I would definitely recommend this film to everyone. Just leave it to Harley, relax and get crazy with her.






Nice action, nice humor, nice harley. Its entertening and it has a good acting from Margot and Ewan. Must see






Having been a fan of the comics and the TV show that came out in 2002. I was surprised and excited that the Birds of Prey we're getting a movie. The movie is a wild ride. I'll start out with that. This is 100% not for children, so be advised. Harley is the main character and I feel like this is as close to a solo film as we are going to get. Margot Robbie is better than ever as Harley Quinn. Her comedic timing is perfect and her action scenes are bone crunchingly bad ass! I am a huge fan of Huntress and have been for a long time. I also love Mary Elizabeth Winstead so I knew the character would be done right and it was. Renée Montoya is a wonderful character played by Rosie Perez. Renée is the oldest of the girls and she plays it with ease and with a sense of street smarts as well. She also has a mean punch. Black Canary is played by Jurnee Smollett-Bell and is a runaway stand out. She is sassy and can kick the crap out of anyone. The Black Canary also has the power of sonic scream and that is awesome to see on screen. The girls are best when they are together hands down. The fight scenes are part John wick and part deadpool in the best ways possible. I really loved the fight scenes. They were surprisingly violent. Ewan McGregor was amazing as Black Mask! Needless to say I want to see more of these characters in the future. Fingers crossed that this gets a few sequels.






This is NOT another Suicide Squad!
Exciting action scenes, awesome musics, hilarious lines and interactions between those ladies.
STOP giving 1 or 2 without even watching it or just because its cast is mainly female!!!






Saw it tonight. It was solid. If Deadpool was amazing from start to finish this is more Deadpool 2. It knew what it wanted to do, but the pacing was lagging at times. There's a part where Harley looks at the audience and does a kind of "deal with it." look but it goes on for an extra 5 seconds like "HEY GET IT? GET IT? YOU SEE WHAT WE DID THERE. LOOK AT WHAT WB LET US DO!", excuse me, it's not one scene...its..a lot of the movie. That said, its fun. I already had a crush on Mary Elizabeth Winstead circa Scott Pilgrim, but she really nailed it as this fish out of water budding vigilante.This is a minor praise, but Ive always been kinda irritated with DC pushing the barely dressed sexy clown modern Harley quinn. They really get it in this movie. They completely yanked all that out and she's back to being more of a scary fashion deaf punk clown. Im glad they got the message. We probably have Margot Robbie as EP to thank.Its also mostly tween friendly. I suspect WB gleefully pursued an R rating hoping it would draw Deadpool money, but its only got a couple mildly gross parts. I only say that because the news is saying parents are avoiding letting their kid fans see it, which sucks. I hope WB makes enough money to keep going with this. I would like to see a sequel.






This movie is a ton of fun. Well acted by Margot Robbie and the rest of the cast. As a big fan of the lovable psychopath Harley Quinn I was not let down at by this movie. I hope to see Harley and the birds of prey in more DC movies in the future. The action scenes were done extremely well in this movie. I also loved that they included little things From the Conner/Palmiotti run of Harley Quinn comics (like her beaver, and her roller derby side gig). Go see it!!!






I don't understand all the 1 star reviews. The movie is really fun and exactly what I expected going in. Probably the only let down is the pacing at the beginning of the movie, which is a bit all over the place. The action is really good (not as R rated as I thought tho) and the movie is really fun!






Harley is back better than ever. In this film, Harley and the joker broke up and she is flying solo. When a young girl picked pocket a diamond from crime lord Black Mask (played by the amazing Ewan McGregor) Harley and three other woman, who share the same vendetta for Black Mask, must protect her.Let me tell you something first. I'm a MASSIVE Marvel fan. I like DC but Marvel makes the better movies. However, having said that, "Birds of Prey" was a fun, action packed thrill of a film. It's basically the Haley Quinn show, but the other female characters had a chance to shine. Margot Robbie was born to play our favourite DC clown princess.There are some flaws with the film. It's a slow builder at the start and the narrative can be a bit confusing. But stick with it. It's worth it.I hope they make a second one of "Birds of Prey". This won't be the last time we see Harley "Frikkin'" Quinn.






Its a budget killing movie. Harley and black mask are awesome.
A perfect r- rated movie 🔥🔥






DC after making a movie in 2019 that completely blew up (Joker) many fans were waiting for a similar style with Harley Quinn's movie. Besides all that the movie was good, a decent plot, they tell the story is a very good way and the effects are good for a DC movie, the soundtrack is amazing and the acting was very good with amazing fighting scenes, has a lot of forced comedy but in general you can laugh pretty easy but the childish personality of Harley Quinn makes the movie sometimes boring.






This is a fun movie. I laughed a lot while watching it, and so did everyone else in the theater. Harley has long been one of my favorite DC universe characters, and Margot Robbie portrayed her well. The violence was first rate, Leto was nowhere to be seen, and the entire cast had good chemistry. What more could anyone ask for in a Suicide Squad sequel?Was the plot intricate and awe inspiring? No, of course not. This is a DC movie, after all. But it had a decent, simple story and carried it out well. There wasn't so much as a single eye-roll inspiring "twist," like, for example, having enemies stop fighting each other and start working together because their moms have the same name. So, that's good.Basically, if you like action comedies and want to leave the theater with a silly grin on your face, give it a shot. Be warned, though, that you will likely also have a strong craving for a fried egg sandwich.






Birds Of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn) is an excellent example of a wild, bonkers and entertaining film where the script is not completely comprised.Sure, the script isn't really great but it's also not completely bad. Plus it makes up for this drawback with splendid action sequences, humorous dialogues and unforgettable performances. Margot Robbie was amazing as ever in her passion project and Ewan McGregor was a convincing villain.Birds of prey is fully self aware about where it stands and what chords it wants to hit. A wild and fun ride, fuelled by great direction, acting and mind blowing action, it is a thoroughly enjoyable flick living up to the "Fantabulous" part of its title and DC fans especially will not be disappointed.






I personally enjoyed it. A lot of clever little moments (the sign of good writing and directing), and well constructed fight scenes (no excessive hand cam ruining everything). There seems to be a lot of trolling in the reviews, so watch it for yourself, have fun, and relax for a 2hrs!






Brilliant film.
Love the tone throughout... Especially a very spoofy beginning and then a very very dark third act.
Some awesome Action sequences in there also.
Harley Quinn was phenomenal! (very similar to the comic book Harley)
And I never thought I would want to see more of black mask!😍Harley Quinn is the DCEU's Deadpool!






It's not the greatest piece of film ever but the story is passable. The action is VERY well shot and very clear. No shaky cam or fast cutting. There's a lot of style akin to suicide squad but this film feels like a film not just one long commercial. The actors all feel right in the roles especially having reas a myriad of comics featuring them. If you're a fan of Gotham Central or the Geoff Loeb Run of Batman you'll dig this. The messages are not shoved down your throat and if you're just having fun with it you may not even really notice them.Robbie McGregor and Winstead are the standouts but everyone comes ready to the party.Give your 10$ and go see it. It's fun. Movies are Allowed to be fun.#32 extra spice.






The movie has some really good moments, the action scenes are pretty good, and Margot Robbie is really good as Harley Quinn, but I found some parts of the movie a bit slow. I would still recommend seeing it if you are a fan of DC movies






Second half was boring and the first half was too good if you love drama






I didn't go into this with much expectation but was honestly blown away. It is an incredibly funny, well-written piece of cinema with fantastic performances from literally the entire cast. This is definitely the best of the DCEU films and I would say one of the best, if not THE best, super hero movies I have seen. Notably, it didn't have the same problem with so many of the Marvel and DC movies (mainly DC) in that it had a very strong, unique villain.






This isn't your normal everyday woman empowering all woman film. It's a well cast well performed action packed and funny movie that just simply entertains. The script is solid and easy to follow and the characters are all likeable down to the stuffed beaver in a tutu. JUST WATCH IT
All the cast the writing and the story was great! Black mask and black canary were the highlights for me. I really hope people see this movie because it is really different and more movies like this one should be made.






Damn!!! That was so cool!!!!!
It is the best DCEU in the world!!!!!






Harley Quinn and the Birds of Prey in a kick ass, balls to the wall movie.
Loved Harley / Dinah / Roman / Helena / BruceLiked Zsasz / Cass / ReneeAction was really cool, grounded combat with a hint of superpowers.Black Mask is towards to the top of best DCEU villains.Only negative was music really, but I know I wasn't there target audience, so I'll let it slide./- 7.5
When you have Margot Robbie in the lead role as Harly Quinn, you don't need anything else.






Lets face it, the DC Extended Universe has been a mess for the most part. Apart from Wonder Woman, most of the rest has been a misfire. None a big offender than Suicide Squad. That film was awful all around and was just a disaster that no one wants to talk about. I wasn't a fan of Robbie's Harley Quinn in that film so much but she's grown on me over the years as a performer ever since I, Tonya. Birds of Prey is certainly an improvement over Suicide Squad and a better entry for DCEU although its not as good as can be.
The film follows the life of one Harley Quinn. She has broken up with the Joker and seeks a new thrill. She somehow gets involved in trying to recover an expensive diamond for an erratic night club owner Roman Sionis. Along the win Harley butts heads with other woman who all are out to seek justice and break chains that keep them restrained. The film stars Margot Robbie, Ewan McGregor, Rosie Perez, and Mary Elizabeth Winstead.
The film is visually an improvement over Suicide Squad. Its brighter and fun, not as dark and gloomy as Suicide Squad. The action sequences are actually quite good, primarily the last fight in the funhouse. Robbie embodies the character better in this film and doesn't have many cringe induced dialogue like in the previous film. I liked Winstead's character Huntress and the humor attached with her name. The film has narative flaws with it being narrated by Quinn and going back and forth I found this to be a weak and overdone way to do things.
There are passages in the film which are pretty boring, basically as it sets up for the final get together. McGregor chews scenery the whole time he is on screen. Overall, DCEU is still a disappointment for the most part but there are moments here and there worth talking about. This film is very on the nose about its women characters and how they are badass working together. While Birds of Prey isn't anything amazing or remarkable its easily one of the better entries in this universe. If this film makes banks, I'm sure the studio will plan a sequel.
6.5/10






Honestly I loved this movie, it had strong female leads, it was funny, it was fast paced and kept moving, and it touched on incredibly important themes like mental illness. Harley is a complex character who's mental instability is on display, but throughout the movie we see her grow and become a sympathetic funny charming character who is a role model.






Yeah you read that right ^ This movie was such a mess and it literally took an hour or more to set up the story, before you find out that there really isnt anything going on except for all the colors and flashyness. Aside from a couple of decent jokes and instances, it really wasnt that funny. In my theater, there was some basement dweller 30+ year old burst out laughing hysterically just because Huntress said "Do you know who I am?" as if she was trying to appear serious or something. None of their characters have their comic book looks through-out the movie, and Black Mask, and Victor Zsasz are really not that intimidating.Suicide Squad and Batman v Superman were honestly better. Dunno about Justice League though, we'd best not talk about that one.The soundtrack songs were good but there was too many of them and it felt like they were just crammed in there.Aside from all the negative, the choreography was really good. Dance and Fight Choreography. One or two mentions of Batman. Nothing Huge.Not worth seeing at all, not just in theaters.Btw, theres no end credit scenes.






First things first. This supposed to be a movie that brings diversiry to a super-hero, or action-hero playground. It should have stand for a diversity, represent feminist vision. But in fact if became the worst example of anti-diversity.Right from the start it rolled into IMAX theaters and filled all the showtimes in it. I mean ALL of the showtimes. In my region there was a second week of "1917" in IMAX and it has been removed to show only "Bird of Prey". So no diversity whatsoever! Do you want to watch an Oscar nominated movie on it's second weekent in IMAX? No! You have only "Birds of Prey" to choose from.Very diverse, IMAX! Bravo!And I wrote to local theaters and to a main IMAX office to clarify this. But the only feedback was - that they have obligations and shedules that they can't overcome. I bet - this is a product of too aggresive placement of WB. They just bought all available showtimes.






After this movie I felt like a strong independent woman who can achieve everything, even though i am a man.
A bit too much feminist agenda but it is okay. It is a very enjoyable movie and I didn't feel bored by the film for a second.






It was excellent. Great story, compelling characters with accompanying origin stories and fantastic action sequences. A colorful, beautiful DC film. Sound track was killer. Run don't walk to see it!!!






Solid movie with a good plot and character development. Better than Suicide Squad.






I love Margot Robbie. I believe the chemistry between Harley role and her is an example for casting. This movie is not bad, especially the second half. But not a "must" movie either. I still believe that Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn has a lot to offer. I hope to see her as Harley in even better movies.






Went to see the movie with very low expectations. Found it actually amusing and the right kind of bonkers. Had some good lough and liked the "you don't need a man to make your own story" message that was presented in the right way. Probably not something a hard core DC fans will enjoy as so many people have pointed out all the flaws but a great watch for some who just want to see something violet and funny.






I went in not expecting a lot from this film, not really heard a lot about it and I was pleasantly surprised. Such a good film, enjoyable, funny, visually entertaining. Margot Robbie is brilliant as Quinn as her associate's in the whole film. Really worth watching.






I had so much fun with this movie, the action was incredible and the acting was great. Margot Robbie and Ewan Mcgregor was the true standouts in this movie, Margot truly is Harley Quinn. The other characters like Black Canary, Huntress, Montoya and Cassandra Cain felt more like side characters in this movie but they still were great. I would rate this movie 9/10.






Don't listen to the all the bad reviews, see it for yourself.






This movie is an absolute blast from beginning to end. It's very similar to Deadpool. Both have non-linear storytelling, they're irreverent, hyperactive, the lead character narrating the film and they both have meta-humor. The comparisons are fair, but this is not a ripoff of Deadpool. It has that same energy, but it does something different with it. Deadpool is a straight-forward revenge story told in non-linear fashion. This a lot more in common with Guy Ritchie's Lock Stock, Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch. It has intersecting narratives dealing with a criminal underground with a MacGuffin the characters are trying to get all told comletley out of order. It's all very interesting and it keeps your mind engaged. It just feels like a fresh and interesting way to tell a story.Another great thing is the cast. The entire cast is a ton of fun. Two obvious standouts are Margot Robbie and Ewan McGregor. Robbie gets to go full Harley Quinn. Of course you get the zany antics, her weird mind and how weridly she interprets the world around her. She gets in on the action and it makes for a ton of great action sequences. She also gets to amoat a lot more. You see the character there and not just the cartoon character. That was a really nice touch that they really made acharacter out of her. McGregor is just so flamboyantly fun yet terrifying at the same time. His character has quirks about how he wants the world to be around him which is so fun to watch while st the same time adds tension into all the scenes.This might have the best action of the entire DCEU. All of the actions sequences are both beautifully coreographed and shot. It can also be quite brutal. There's a lot of broken legs inside of the film. Harley Quinn is just destroying these guys by going for there knees and it's all very fun to watch. It can also be graphiccally violent. I'm so glad they went for an R rating.It's also really funny from beginning to end. It's being narrated by Harley Quinn so we're seeing all of this interpreted from her weird perspective. It just finds every single opportunity for a joke.The bad thing about the movie is that at times it can be a little confusing. With all of the time-jumping and non-linear storytelling I was way more confused than I should have been. This isn't really a big deal, but there are elements of that in the film.Second bad thing is that Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Ella Jay Basco felt like the weak links in the cast. Almost everyone else is really good and for different reasons each of their performances felt a bit off. Basco felt like a younger actress. She's next to some people that are in the Oscar category and she just felt not quite in their league so her delivery wasn't as sharp. Winstead 's character is written to be a bit awkward inside of the story which is a bit of an excuse for this, but her acting for me just felt flat. There was a clever idea that they were doing with her that I just didn't find as convincing as I found everyone else.But those are very minor issues, but overall, this is a movie that I found incredibly enjoyable and absolutely blew my expectations out of the water.9/10 you should definetley go see this film.






It was the summer of 2016. I was sitting in a theater viewing the DC Comics pic, Suicide Squad. Sadly, it was out of sorts, disjointed, and feverishly edited. I didn't quite dig it like I dug its trailer. Cut to four years later and "Squad's" follow-up (Birds of Prey) is a well-tuned improvement. Its title character named Harley Quinn, becomes "the mighty Quinn" (Ha).Anyway, Birds of Prey has to do with Harley (Margot Robbie), Harley's recovery from her Joker breakup, her love of fried egg sandwiches, and her dodging from thugs led by a criminal mind known as Black Mask (Ewan McGregor). Robbie and McGregor are the acting standouts here. They are a nasty hoot playing respectively, the antihero protagonist and the snobbishly villain bully.Reflecting on Birds of Prey, I was reminded of the female version of Suicide Squad. Joining forces with Harley Quinn are the "crossbow killer" (Huntress), a Gotham City Police Detective (Renee Montoya), a vigilante (Black Canary), and a pickpocket (Cassandra Cain). They are all girly girl badasses and they put on a superior action showcase in "Prey's" last fifteen minutes.Prey's Director (Cathy Yan) shoots hyperkinetic fighting scenes and car chases spiked with a deranged, carnival feel. Her look of the film is cinematic cotton candy, rainbow snow cones, and sweet, dirty perfume. Yan also likes to occasionally freeze a frame and use a telestrator to outline a character's face. Finally, she tells "Prey's" story to a somewhat Rashomon effect. That means there are flashbacks and various interpretations of "Prey's" slightly messy plot mechanics.Like most DC flicks, Birds of Prey isn't epic or crucial but boy is it a lot of fun (yup, there might be a sequel). "Prey" is demented, fantasyland stuff and with every violent bone crack and every dry humored quip, you get a mucky wink wink from everyone involved. Rating: 3 stars.
This film has rocketed up my list of favorite superhero movies (and I'm primarily an MCU fan). It is absolutely amazing, Robbie is a fantastic Harley Quinn, yet again! All the other ladies are exceptional as well and McGregor makes a fantastic bad guy too. I will say the movie is quite violent and there's a lot of swearing, but it didn't bother me. I thought it was terrific!To everyone saying it's an anti-men movie, it's not! It's about Harley Quinn, and she broke up with the Joker. She is obviously upset and mad and that is why he is portrayed badly. The main villain is also a man, but that's not really unusual. It's a terrific movie, and I highly suggest you give it a shot!






I loved this film!! This is just my very personal opinion. As a 23yo girl who likes superheroes, it is amazing to feel that I can be one too! (as a girl). It's not the same for me to say that I want to be like superman or batman cause they have their own style and they are men and even If i try to imitate them, we have very little in common but when I get to see movies like this where women are the stars is just WOW. I feel super connected with them because they're not only superheroes or villains but they are girls that get dirty and fight and not the common stuff of a delicate girl or whatever stereotypes are for us. Idk.. I just love to feel like I, as a woman, can be super powerful as well. for good or for evil but I can get dirty and grotesque and fight as well. 10/10 I loved every single moment of it, although is not really the best movie in cinema aspects, it's a superhero movie after all and I feel like it should be seen as that and don't care much about if what you see is "stupid" or "dramatic" cause that's the point.






Birds of Prey is a highly entertaining action film that is clearly not for kids. For the first time, you get to see Harley Quinn's real bat and hammer action with blood. Margot Robbie is such a fine actress, that I believe she was born to play this role. Her performance as a witty action (anti)heroine is nothing but flawless. I really can't wait to see her in this role again, and for now, this film has left me satisfied.Birds of Prey can be compared more with John Wick or The Equalizer instead of Superman or Batman. This is the best female action movie I've seen till date, and I'm not kidding. You get loads of action, a good amount of humor and a ton of memorable characters. I thought Mary Elizabeth Winstead was excellent as the Huntress, and clearly my second favorite after Harley Quinn in this film. Every action film about a team tends to have at least one tough and serious character and Huntress is that. Harley, however, is a mix of both tough and sweet: presented in a way that you just can't hate her. All actors and actresses were truly awesome throughout the film, including Ewan McGregor.The action is the biggest highlight of this film, and is possibly the best action in a DC movie till date. It uses slow-motion and camera angles brilliantly, and its raw nature is the real icing on the cake. If you like action movies based on comic book characters and are an adult, check it out with a tub of popcorn. There's something really charming about the film's visuals, and it actually feels like a comic book has come alive.Birds of Prey, in simple words, is an exhilarating action film that is a must watch for anyone who's into action movies and DC comics. Just make sure kids don't see it, because it really has mature content that isn't meant for them.






What a great feel good Friday night movie. Margot steels the show






Crazy, action, funny and entertaining is Bird of prey.






This film is certainly a very good movie.
Whit a very ingeniusly beginning that marks which kind of movie will you see.
Under my opinion whit the best villian of the DCEU whit a spectacular performance of Ewan McGregor like Black Mask.
I was surprised whit characters like Huntress, Black Canary and Victor Zsaz.
The only character under my opinion that didn't have anything special funny or something like this is Cassandra Cain.
Margot Robbie is spectacular in his role as Harley Quinn.
This film has a loot of easter-eggs that a Dc Fan will Love.
To finish I only cann say go to see this fantastic movie






Action 10/10
Story 8/10
Soundtruck 8/10
The movie is very beautiful I liked the story and the music and the fighting all the actors created in the movie






Ive seen this film twice now as wanted to make sure i hadnt overlooked anything or jumped to judgement after the first viewing. First and foremost it has very little to do with the birds of prey and instead is a Harley Quinn movie bar the final 20 minutes. It starts by trying to fill in the gaps between Suicide Squad and the start of this film, but essentially is just Harley explaining her and the Joker are no more. There's a loose plot but not what ud call a well developed or fleshed out one. By including the BOP they set themselves a huge task of trying to introduce them all, bring them together develop a plot all the while trying to give the bulk of screen time to the star Margot Robbie. The result is a somewhat chaotic mess that at points works but never fully realises its potential. Its clear they have studied and tried to use what Deadpool did as a guideline but falls short at nearly every turn. Yes there's the excessive use of swearing and crude humour alongside violence but it lacks the originality and character making it seem a little forced. You can see they knew what they wanted to achieve but in being so determined to try make it like that they have become their own biggest enemy. It feels like its trying too hard whereas Deadpool felt natural like they didnt try to write it a certain way its just how it was written. The film is different and has some genuinely good moments but it also feels rushed and a tad disjointed. There are moments where its a little too childish but not in a good way. I respect what they have attempted but ultimately i fear it will actually be the thing that prevents future sequels. If you have to try realky hard to make something seem genuine the chances are its not, i would have liked to see them not trying to mimick the success and style of other R rated comic movies and instead forge its own path. A longer runtime would have also allowed for more plot and character development. I think younger audiences will enjoy it altho the R rating makes that harder and subsequently will effect its box office. Its bright, energetic and has a good cast its just a shame they aren't fully utilised. The soundtrack is great and used perfectly. Its set itself up for future films but im not sure how quickly they will come around. Not much of an improvement on Suicide Squad and less enjoyable than than some of DC's more recent efforts such as Shazam which did a great job of incorporating humour. 6/10 enjoyable but ultimately tries too hard.
I enjoyed it. Sort of like John Wick meets Deadpool. And it didn't have that boring flat same-y kinda look and feel you get from many Marvel films. It has a personality, a vision, and it's directed with style. Margot Robbie just killed it as Harley Quinn. She was born to play this role... Some might be put off by the whole girl power, feminist, progressive vibe, but I still liked it, and I'm not even a feminist or anything.






This is not a movie meant for a good solid script, story or being serious in any way. It's about a crazy Harley that gives an amazing performance. I went to see Harley kick some ass in some amazing action scenes and i enjoyed it. Don't expect anything else and the movie will be 10x better than suicide squad.






Welcome back to Stream to Big Screen! Now, it's time for the DC Universe to expand on the big screen. Meet the Birds of Prey as introduced by the fantabulous Harley Quinn. Yes, that irrepressible, wild card and former paramour of the Joker is emancipated from the Suicide Squad and shepherding us through the origin story of that lady gang, featuring Renee Montoya, Black Canary and The Huntress. Margot Robbie reprises effervescent and sly portrayal of Harley. Here, she dominates. I don't know what Birds of Prey would be without her.Like most origin stories, Birds of Prey starts each character off in their own contained silo until they all come together in order to service the plot. As comic book movies go, this plot is not important. A bad guy wants a thing that will give him money to dominate the city. The "good" guys, or in this case the better girls, want to stop him because he's a jerk trying to harm an innocent kid. Yada yada yada! Crash, bang, boom! The movie ends. Let's be honest, you're not going to see this movie because you want to be surprised by what happens.Cathy Yan's direction of the film can barely contain all of the energy Robbie brings to Harley Quinn, which makes the titular, Birds of Prey, take a bit of a backseat, and the screenplay by Christina Hodson is a little all over the place. I actually wish it had been funnier. There are funny quips here and there, but overall I wasn't LOLing as much as I had hoped. There's so much going on throughout the film. There are cartoon vignettes, explosions, and a lot of kicking butt. Also, Ewan McGregor, playing Roman Sionis, this movie's mustache-twisting villain, and Chris Messina, the sinister henchman, are so outsized in their performances that they make more of an impact that the Birds of Prey as well - although McGregor, in particular, should have been reined in a bit. In fact, I wish there had been more to The Huntress. She just recedes in the background while both Renee Montoya, played by Rosie Perez, and Black Canary, played by Jurnee Smollett-Bell, get good moments and hold their own against the otherwise dominating Harley Quinn.Nevertheless, there is a lot to like aside from just Margot Robbie. The film's runtime is manageable and not bloated like some other comic book movies - I'm looking at you, Marvel Universe. In general, the movie moves at a good clip, not really wasting time. The fight scenes have a lot of pizzazz to them, which is interesting considering how dark films set in Gotham can be. Also, there are some really good and interesting music choices sprinkled throughout.Birds of Prey is worth the price of a ticket in the theater. It was a fun night at the cinema. Sure, the plot isn't important but you're really just there to see Harley Quinn wreak havoc. And, havoc she wreaks!I think we completely agree on this one. DC Comics has provided one of their more entertaining films with Birds of Prey. When the dust clears, DC has provided the theaters their female Deadpool-like protagonist. I do wish the movie were a bit funnier and the villain a bit more essential to the story but I'll suffice with great fight scenes instead. This movie definitely is a good watch on the big screen but save yourself a few bucks with a matinee showing.






Just got back from watching Birds of Prey and gotta say that it was well worth the wait to see Margot Robbie reprise the role of the awesome Harley Quinn. Story was a little slow to start but when it got going she kicked! DC continues to show the darker side of our super heroes ! Better than Suicide Squad. Only down side was no Joker but then the film would have ended up being more about him than Quinn. Ewan MaGregor played a decent baddie Black Mask.! It really was setting up the next film which will undoubtedly be without Quinn and more about the Birds. Never the less that's for a discussion later. Get chilled kick back and enjoy the first super hero film of 2029






This movie should be at 1 star but Ewan McGregor tries to salvage this hot pile. The plot is terrible, the pacing is way off, and they bounce timelines all over the place. Further proof that DC has no ideas how to work a connect universe. This ranks up there with Justice League, Suicide Squad, and Batman vs. Superman in regards to how bad they are. Save your money, unless you really love Ewan McGregor.






Let me first address the elephant in the room; this is a Feminist Film. But it is nowhere near as bad as junk like "Ghostbusters 2016", "Oceans 8", or the Disney Star Wars trilogy. These female characters are human beings with personal issues, personal wants, and personal desires. They are not God-tier cardboard cut-outs who happen to be female. All of these characters are unique in some way. This is feminism done correctly- not better than man- but equal. And not EVERY man in the film is terrible. (Pay attention to Huntress' origin in the film for that).
Remember when we were all blown away by the trailers for "Suicide Squad"? How it looked like dark, fun, over-the-top nonsense that was also a good time? Remember how let down we were- with its dull story, dull villain, next-to-no character development and so on? This delivers what we wanted from the trailers of "Suicide Squad." It is very brutal, very violent, has tons of swearing to the point of self-parody, and is a darn fun time.
It also has a ton of character development which made the story better for me especially in Harley realizing how "less a bad person" she could be. Whereas in "Suicide Squad" where she told the man who killed his family to "Own that s!" she comes full-circle by risking her life to save a kid.
I was a little disappointed with how Black Mask was handled, and could do without the political and magnified men-can-be-rotten-towards-women spotlight being as subtle as a deaf person playing piano with a hammer- but I gave this film a chance, and I was not disappointed. Pretty Good.






Having seen this last night on opening night if is yet another in what seems to be the never ending failure of DC comics on the big screen.DC needs to take a page from their CW shows that are genuinely good and expand it to the big screen. Like ALL DC comic books, except Wonder Woman and Aquaman, this is another huge failure.






Great, fun movie. Very captivating and well done and probably one of my favorite comic book movies ever. It's so colorful and thrilling, and the characters are well written and acted. Margot Robbie was AMAZING as was Ewan McGregor!






Okay so i walked in knowing i was gonna like this movie but what i idnt expect was to love it the story moves fast and is action packed its such a fun ,movie i highly recommend it to anyone laughs action just see it see it see it best movie of the mionth






I dont know why people are saying that this movie aint good. Like today i watched the movie and honestly i would give 8.5/10 to this movie . Some people are just showing hate to this movie just because its a women centric movie . But i gotta say every male actor has done a great job . Ewan mcgregor nails the role pf black mask . It is a good movie , you wont be disappointed.






I don't care what anyone says about this movie it is way more better than Suicide Squad. And everything about this movie is absolutely mesmerizing! Margot Robbie played Harley perfect! Best dceu movie in my opinion. I love it more than Justice League. So ten stars for me :))






After watching this movie, I wanted to cut my hair, get multiple tattoos, shred my shirts and learn acrobatic street style fighting. It was awesome to see beautiful women kick all sorts of booty on screen. Quirky and heartfelt in my opinion.






Great movie to be honest. There were various scenes that I felt could've been cut or shortened but I enjoyed it none the less. I can't wait for more Margot Robbie in The Suicide Squad






What's the point mention everybody and not even a cameo? At some point reason, law and physics even gravity left the building. And I'm not even mentioning the comics because I went with an open mind. But I have a feeling that in time this will be a cult classic.
This movie supposed to be Harley Quinn's standalone but managed to introduce new heroes to the DCEU in the same time. this movie is really meant to be made in R-rated, seems like DC has already learn their mistakes from Suicide Squad and BVS.
Another good forward move for DC as the Harley Quinn badass performance , black canary, huntress all are badass female characters that brought to life by the Margot Robbie..... I love this... Action sequences were jaw dropping..FOR MISTER J






Super awesome fun film really watch with your wife,daughter or girlfriend good movie






Watched Birds Of Prey to Open The New Decade And the 2020 Movie Season starring Oscar Nominee Margot Robbie(Once Upon A Time In Hollywood) as Dr.Harleen Quinzel/Harley Quinn , Jurnee Smollett-Bell(Friday Night Lights) as Dinah Lance/Black Canary, Mary Elizabeth Winstead(10 Cloverfield Lane) As Helena Bertinelli/Huntress Rosie Perez(The Road To El Dorado) as Renee Montoya,, Ellie Jay Basco as Cassie Cane, Ali Wong(Always Be My Maybe) as Ellen Yee, Chris Messina(Argo) as Victor Zsaz, Ewan McGregor(Star Wars,Doctor Sleep) as Roman Sionis/Black Mask who is the First Gay Villain in The DCEU.I had fun with this Movie also Margot Robbie Cemented Herself as Harley Quinn like Ryan Reynolds did With Deadpool also Ewan Mcgregor seem to have fun playing Black Mask in only third villain role and Smollet-Bell did amazing as Black Canary better than her Arrowverse counterparts and Winstead did great in her brief scenes as Huntress I had dun with this movie while 2020 will have more stronger releases in the CBM world I had fun this was DCEU's version of Deadpool 2 which was its strength I enjoyed the Humor and its wackiness also had a great soundtrack and diversity.
Great Costume Design By Erin Benach(A Star Is Born)and Score By Daniel Pemerbton(The Dark Crystal; Age Of Resistance) , Cinematography by Matthew Libatique(Venom) and Amazing Direction by Cathy Yan(According To My Mother) DCEU Version Of Deadpool 2 7/10






Birds of Prey has a good story, all the performances are great, and the movie is visually great. Margot Robbie continues to be great as Harley Quinn, making her even more wild with her narration. But the narration makes the story slightly difficult to follow, with continued flashbacks. Mary Elizabeth Winstead could have gotten more screen time, but she did well with what she had. Jurnee Smollett-Bell kicked ass as Black Canary, even though she only displays her powers once. Rosie Perez plays Renee Montoya as a badass who learns not to take crap from other cops, who are usually corrupt. Ella Jay Basco does a good job as a young Cassandra Cane, even though it's not really accurate to the comics. As for the villains, Ewan McGregor does a great job showing Black Mask's somewhat bipolar nature, going from calm to insane in an instant. Chris Messina is crazy as Victor Zsasz, making a pretty good interpretation of the comics.The film has great comedic timing, and the colorful visuals alone make it much better than Suicide Squad. It has shades of Deadpool and Guardians of the Galaxy without too being too similar. Take the film for what it is, an entertaining movie with some pretty good action, and some great jokes. Just because it's female led and the two main villains are men doesn't mean it's anti-men. Unfortunately, it likely won't have a large box office because of its R rating, along with it being marketed to a relatively younger audience. Strangely enough (not really), it's getting generally good critical reviews, so take that as you will.Lastly, that bacon, egg, and cheese looked really good so I don't blame Harley.
Don't take it seriously and it's ok. Margrot Robbie gives a good performance.






This is one fun and colourful adventure. The scene when Harley enters the police station is really cool. The songs are good, the make up is good, and I like the ensemble group they form at the end as well.






A follow-up to and spin-off of Suicide Squad - and the eighth film in the troubled DC Cinematic Universe - I was completely ready to write off Birds of Prey as a complete waste of time. But you know what? I loved it. I was throughly entertained by every moment of the film, as it took what worked in Suicide Squad - the wacky intros and pretty much everything with Harley Quinn - and amped it up while throwing away the boring stuff that didn't.It was written by Christina Hodson (Bumblebee) and directed by Cathy Yan, whose direction is solid and assured.Harley Queen says that she's escaped her old life after breaking up with the Joker, but she's still enjoying the safety that being seen as his woman affords her. Yet after a night of drunken debauchery, she blows up the Ace Chemical plant where she gave herself over to her abusive ex-lover and declares herself a free agent. That, of course, brings down the wrath of every person she's wronged over the past few years.It also brings her into the orbit of Detective Renee Montoya (Rosie Perez), Dinah "Black Canary" Lance (Jurnee Smollett-Bell), child thief Cassandra Cain and Helena "Huntress" Bertinelli (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), who become kind of sort of friends with her as they battle Roman "Black Mask" Sionis (Ewan McGregor) who is trying to take over Gotham City from his nightclub.There are also some great smaller roles for Chris Messina (who was awesome on Sharp Objects) as Mr. Zsasz and Ali Wong as Montoya's ex, district attorney Ellen Yee.There's a MacGuffin of the diamond that contains all the money information for the wiped out Bertinelli family, but it really doesn't matter. What you're watching for are the kinetic fights, interplay between the girls and an over the top performance by McGregor. Everyone seems to be having the time of their lives here. It's one of those movies that you walk away and think, "That must have been fun to make."For her part, Robie pushed for this movie and helped develop it for more than two years. It takes the Harley Quinn character well beyond where she started and lands her closer to where she fits into the DCU comics today. Speaking of comics, a younger me may have been upset that continuity isn't strictly followed and that origins are slightly tweaked. Older me has much more pressing issues than being one of the Monitors of the multiverse and just enjoys watching fistfights and hijinks.Watching this film reminds you how dreary and boring the rest of the DCU has been, while being thankful that Deadpool allowed executives to realize that comic book films don't have to be PG-rated efforts.There's nothing like being pleasantly surprised by a movie. And I'm pleased to report that even after sleeping on this review overnight, I still find myself remembering plenty to love in this one.
Actually a good movie! The trailers do make the movie cheesy but it's far from it! Margot Robbie plays Harley Quinn down to the comics! Don't let these spoilers turn you away as some of the people leaving reviews have clearly not watched the movie!!






I had high hopes for this movie, I thought this would be a unique type of movie but it didn't stood up to that expectation. But coming to the best part of this movie is Harley Quinn other characters are just touched in this movie. Action scenes were great, believe me they were superb. Also I think they didn't do justice to the Black Mask character, he is very powerful guy in comics but in this movie he is shown very weak and full of frustration. Black Canary was better than I expected.






I dont know why people are showing hate to this movie . I mean Its a good movie . Better than suicide squad . People are showing hate as if its even worse than suicide squad . Its a pretty good and watchable movie .






It was more the mess I hoped for... I honestly had no intent to see this movie at all but then I was invited to go by my best friend and said fudge it. I am honestly glad I went. This movie is a total hot mess... but not the mess I expected... totally the mess I wanted.. A. it passed the bechdel test with flying colors B. no Jared Leto ever C. So much delicious violence.... like soooooo much.... if you want to see girls kicking ass with a stick to the man then this is definitely the movie... it's colorful, action PACKED, woman power awesomeness. Anyone judging this movie angrily probably has an issue with women being empowered. It wasn't perfect and no matter how hard Margot tries she's just not NOT the animated series Harley... but it was actually a quality hot mess...






So the movie was good and not bad!! I really loved Margot Robbie Harley Quinn!! I also loved the ratings R!!The bad thing is probably first half of the movie is pretty slow!!






I really wanted to love this film Ewan McGregor didn't play a baddy well some pointless bits of violence where he was trying to be a tough man didn't quite get his role as the mask. Margot Robbie excellent as always as Harley Quinn some of the other characters took a while to get into overall okay film but it could've been so much better Warner Brothers you must try harder






What an amazing movie! I loved it from beginning to end. It had the perfect amount of everything, perfect fight scenes, jokes, story etc. I absolutely loved it!!! Hope there's a part 2!






Birds of Prey: And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn continues with the adventures of Harley Quinn(Margot Robbie), after the events of Suicide Squad(2016). After breaking up with the Joker, Harley teams up with Helena Bertinelli/The Huntress(Mary Elizabeth Winstead), Dinah Lance/Black Canary(Jurnee Smollett-Bell) & Renee Montoya(Rosie Perez), to protect a young girl named Cassandra Cain(Ella Jay Basco), from malevolent crime kingpin Roman Sionis(Ewan McGregor) & sinister assassin Victor Zsasz(Chris Messina).Birds of Prey: And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn is a fantastic film. Director Cathy Yan has finally given us an anti-hero movie we deserve, after the slightly disappointing Suicide Squad(2016). Harley Quinn who is undoubtedly the best part of the 2016 super villain team-up film, is front & center this time around. The R-rating definitely helps. Now, there are no compromises made to the action set pieces. The action set pieces are jaw-dropping. The comedic scenes will leave you guffawing. The visual effects are flawless. The prologue is unique & hilarious. Margot Robbie is the star of the show, as Harley Quinn. Robbie portrays various emotions with ease & grace & definitely deserves to be one of the key players of the DC Extended Universe, going forward. Rosie Perez is great as Renee Montoya. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is brilliant as Helena Bertinelli/The Huntress. Jurnee Smollett-Bell is outstanding as Dinah Lance/Black Canary. Ewan McGregor is having the time of his life, as the deplorable yet deliciously evil, Roman Sionis. Ella Jay Basco is amazing as Cassandra Cain. Chris Messina is superb as Victor Zsasz. Birds of Prey: And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn is a must watch for fans of Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn. Go, have an absolute whale of a time! Can't wait for The Suicide Squad(2021).






I don't know why people think it's boring like so much was happening in the movie, honestly looking at the trailer I expected it to be not great but it turned out to be pretty good, so it's better then I expected.






Someone told me it was going to be a cross between John Wick and some other movie. More of that other movie than John Wick but it was ok. A little too much narration by Miss Quinn but overall it was a good movie.
I felt it had potential to be more as I could not help but to notice I their focused attempts to kinda make a solo Harley Quinn movie the waters down the full potential of the Birds of Prey. Cross fingers that they fix that in a follow up movie.
Overall, worth taking a look at.






Bad movie. I liked the reshoots by JohnWick's director, Chad Stahelski, because the previous version was terrible without those action sequences. I liked the arc of Huntress as well, she's a good assassin. And the flashbacks and flashforwards like Pulp Fiction. But everything else is a disaster. The little Chinese girl swallows a diamond and Black Mask wants to kill her to take it back. The 5 girls gather to fight at the end because of the fate (and the script). People who were in the theater preferred to look at their cell phones in front of boring scenes, you can cut 40 minutes and it looks better. This is NOT DC COMICS. Ewan McGregor's character was crap. The post-credit scene was stolen from Deadpool.






It fun, it's creative, it's badass. And Margo Robbie is fan freaking tastik.Just watch it! :)






It is a okay movie you Can go watch but i dont like it it hate it but it is a great Girl powerd movie and The acting is great






Hilarious, stylish, and powerful, the Birds are no man's prey. Margot Robbie and the talented women making this film actually got me out to the theatre and I was not disappointed. The ladies kick some serious tail, and the Harley Fu made the fight scenes entertaining and satisfying when I usually find fighting boring. The disjointed narrative is perfectly congruent with the state of Harley's mind. They problem-solve and succeed by supporting each other as total badasses. This is a movie about women, made by women, for women & the people who love & respect women. Definitely check it out.






I was excited for this movie ever since it was announced, and it lived up to my expectations, the movie was great, Margot knocked it out of the park with a sensational performance, she proved again why she is one of the best! Ewan was a good villain, Black Canary and Huntress were cool, Cassandra did well. The movie is funny and has some of the best action sequences you'll see, really enjoyable, I need more Harley Quinn, highly recommended!






Totally a MUST watch Deserves 10 stars! The color scheme is beautiful! And the story line is INCREDIBLE






So reading lots of the reviews, makes you wonder how many actually went to watch it, and not just the trailer.So, that aside, yes it has issue, the pacing is off in places, which leads to an uncomfortable first third of the movie. That aside, that's where it picks up and becomes more stable in pace and action all the way to the third act crescendo.The casting over all is pretty good, personally aside from Margot Robbie reprising Harley Quinn,, Jurnee Smollett-Bell was for me was brilliant, especially when I saw she had done her own vocals on the soundtrack.The film was never set out to be a riotess comedy, it has laughs, it has great action and yes, the plot is not up there with Knives Out.Seems people just want to hate on this because ?






I am a hardcore DC fan and i dont like feminism but i really liked this movie, the soundtracks were awesome and overall it was a great experience. The only scene i hated tho was that stupid musical with Harley.
Birds of Prey and The Fantabulous Emancipation of one Harley Quinn. A great film in the DCEU not one of the best but one I enjoyed more than Suicide Squad with a simple story and some fantastic action this film is a fun ride from start to finish.The story is very simple but works for the movie the idea of Harley now going on her own is an amazing idea and this is great adaptation of that story arc from the comics.
Margot Robbie does an amazing job once again in the main role.The Birds of Prey are introduced and there story ties in with Harleys in a very good way and these characters are handled really well my favourite being The Huntress she was great the only downfall is we don't see enough of them as the Birds Of Prey and its treated more of like a backdoor pilot so they can do a spinoff movie.Ewan McGregor is fantastic in this as Black Mask it's not an adaptation I would of done with the character but it works for the movie and he does a brillant job in the role.
There are some unnecessary moments with him though like when hes making the woman strip in the club.The action is fantasic in this movie and a lot of fun to watch and I will say its the best action in a DC movie to date in my opinion it has a very John Wick style to it and is very stylish.
The humour in the movie is handled really well as well.The only real issues I have with the movie are We don't see the Birds Of Prey team that much and it seems more of a set up for another movie.
There's also some unnecessary scenes the club scene with Black Mask and there's a scene with Harley doing a Marilyn Monroe scene that just seems out of place.The final action scene is my favourite moment the Black Canary moment was awesome for a comic fan such a fun action scene and has some great comedy moments in it as well it also shows how great they work as a team.Verdict 8.5/10 a great movie that is alot of fun and has some great action in it Harley is fantastic and the Birds Of Prey characters are great just wish we saw more of them. All in all a great film from start to finish.
The film is entertaining, margot robbie is a good actress playing harley quinn character, but the script is a little bit lazy, but afterall is a good film






Firstly this movie is great. If your a fan of deadpool and that type of action and comedy you'll find this to be enjoyable. The one flaw for me was the pacing was off with all the flashbacks that come and go but besides that it's a fun and great movie.






It was fun and i enjoyed it. Could it beter? Of course yes but dont go with high expextations and try to enjoy your time






For those who've read some of the comics they'll agree that Harley isn't someone who necessarily plans everything before she does it which is what Robbie took into account when bringer her to life, things from the comics such as Hyenas and beavers were brought in the movie as well which is nice to see as a comic fan. Also in a scene towards the end we see officer Montoya wear one if Harley's bust plates which are quite reoccurring in the comics. Other characters weren't as developed and praised as Harley was (but she's the narrator so what can you do), This movie showed Harley really being and becoming her own person; her habits, her dress style her attitude in the outside world but didn't do the others justice. Huntress was boring with one mission which she fulfilled. Canary could've been made more interesting if they had included more of her screeches and vocal abilities and officer Montoya was boring too. Only the last 20 mins showed the characters come together. Great set and aesthetic design and even better makeup and costume. Despite the negative things, Harley is the main focus so much that it's the only reason why it's worth watching
This film delivered on fronts for me, it's a solid action movie. The cast was without a doubt the best part as they all shine in their own ways and through some masterful direction fit together with ease. Even with Robbie's immense screen presence, it doesn't feel like as much of a "Harley Quinn show" as I expected. Rosie Perez chewed up the scenery every chance she got and the world is truly a better place for it. Jurnee Smollett-Bell brought a real "blacksploitation" feel to the movie. I would have loved more of Winstead's Huntress but I understand why they didn't give her as much focus to the story. Hopefully we get a sequel where we can get more of her awkward badassery. Ewan McGregor was such a great villain, he felt truly vile and petty, giving us such a fun character to root against. Last but absolutely not least, Ella Jay Basco was delightful. That kid has one hell of a future in Hollywood if she decides to stick with it.The action is non-stop and flows from brightly colored setting to brightly colored setting with ease. The fight choreography is brutal, just over the top enough to make sure you know it's a comic book movie, and with plenty of moments to get a crowed reaction. It's violent, vulgar and grimy feeling in the best of ways.The amount of love and care that Margot Robbie has for her character and her drive to set up this story (and I hope this leads to more BOP and Gotham City Sirens films) shines through more than anything. She fought tooth and nail to get this movie to happen and we have ended up with what is in my opinion a very good candidate for the best DCCU film thus far, which is saying something because Wonder Woman, Shazam! and Aquaman were all pretty excellent.While not a perfect movie, it's damn good. 8/10.
Nowadays it is difficult to find originality in entertainment, rarely enjoy a movie nowadays, it may not be the best movie but Birds of Prey offers a very entertaining original idea, its tone of humor and its scenes Action is an enjoyable mix, and its quite ideal soundtrack, perhaps its biggest problem is that it doesn't feel like a Birds of Prey movie, it's more like a Harley Quinn movie with a bit of other characters, the tone is good but it could be better if I only had more time to give the development and scenes to the other characters, even so it is still entertaining from beginning to end and the ideal option to see something fun for the weekend






Just as the title says this is a solid movie. Not great not terrible but worth watching if you're into the DC/Marvel movies. I enjoyed it and would recommend seeing it.






This movie was really fun and entertaining, I enjoyed it. Don't get caught up in the negative reviews, especially if you're a Harley Quinn fan. I honestly enjoyed this far more than Suicide Squad, probably one of the better DC movies to come out in the past few years, in my opinion.






I just got out of a surprisingly packed screening of Birds Of Prey.Disclosure, I'm not familiar with the comics, so I don't know if the character portrayal are accurate or not. BL k Madk for example, I do not know if this is his comic story arc or notI knew going in it would be a girl power movie, as it's Birds Of Prey, but every man in this is a horrible, vile, misogynistic d*ck. Literally every male character is a would be rapist, sexist woman hater. You can have a girl power movie without making it a man hating one. And it's not really a Birds Of Prey movie either, It's a Harley Quinn movie. That out of the way...What I liked about this movie is I love Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn, what ever you hated about Suicide Squad, everyone pretty much agreed she was the best thing in it. Mary Elizabeth Winstead (so bad in Gemini Man) is good as Huntress, but she had the least screentime, I could watch an entire movie around the backstory shown briefly here she has the best arc. Her and Black Canary (Jurnee Sonnet-Bell) were the best characters after Harley Quinn.It is well directed, the action is well shot, you can actually see what is going on, and it's choreographed well in long shots instead of lots of cut aways and no shaky cam. There are a lot of appendage breaks (the most I have seen since I did the Steven Seagal movie marathon) considering what happens to people in the movie, there is not a great deal of blood, although it's littered with F Bombs!!There were some decent laughs, one in particular got a huge reaction in my screening, but I think it could have used a few more laughs.Ewan McGregor is fine, he is having fun, but a little too over the top. Rosie Perez is bland and dull as the cop, her and Casandra Cain (Ella Jay Basco) for me were a waste of screentime. I'd have rather there screen time went to Black Canary and Huntress. Although Cain is integral to the plot, she is just a waste of screentime. She is also the worst movie pickpocket of all time.There is no characterisation outside of Harley Quinn (she is the only one you actually care about) and Huntress, the main plot (retrieving a diamond) is nothing we have not seen before. I had some issues with the police raid, which was awesome, even if it does not make sense.Some scenes from the trailers are not in the movie!! For example the scene where she says "Boom" and appears to headbutt someone is not there.I think it will split the fans, you will either like it or hate it!! I'm pretty sure it's depiction of men will rub a lot of people up the wrong way. I can't say I disliked it, as I was entertained through out, because it was a fun movie, so I'm kind of on the fence, but I do think it will have decent rewatchability.






I want to give credit for the film making a fun, female led film. It's important that people not overlook the merits of the movie as a representative of women in film when considering the critiques. The cast was good. The characters were fun.That said, the movie was an action comedy, but most of it wasn't that funny. I laughed a few times and I did smile, but there no part of the movie that will stick with me next week.Also, though the set pieces were visually pleasing, some of them didn't make diegetic sense. Furthermore, there was a LOT of slo mo.Finally, the narration. There was entirely too much. Some don't see that as a detractor, but the truth is that it actively took away from the movie in places.In summation, it was fun, but it wasn't good.






First I would like to point out that I dislike people who call this a feminist film, cause only reasoning would be that the leads are mostly female.Secondly, Birds of Prey tells the story of HQ who just broke up with the Joker. It's funny, well acted and the cinematography is beautiful. Action scenes are above standard but the story is not. Nothing we haven't seen before.This movie will entertain you and is in my opinion one of the better DC movies. Have fun in theaters!
Wow this movie surprised me. The energy is just fun and all the actors do well in their parts. Margot robbie should be proud of this project. Margot Mary Jurnee Ewan and Rosie kill it in their roles and I would absolutely love to see some of them come back for spin offs






Birds of Prey was everything I hoped for. Full of amazing female empowerment, great quirky moments from Harley Quinn, incredible costumes and makeup, solid soundtrack, beautiful cinematography!
DC is aiming the right way with that one!9/10 hope for a sequel. ✨






Just seen it this evening and loved it.It was funny and off the wall and had some amusing fight scenes.I love the fact that Harley quinn manages to show her soft girly side whilst beating a group of blokes with a mallet.I always get a kick out of the bad guys doing the right thing for the wrong reasons. Will definitely be adding this one to my collection.






Birds of Prey (5 out of 5 stars).Birds of Prey is an awesome superhero film focusing its story line of Harley Quinn and her coming across other female vigilante's like Black Canary, Huntress, and Renee Montoya. Birds of Prey is like the DCs version of Deadpool. It is fun, it breaks the ground barrier of fourth wall narration from Harley's storytelling, and the action is bloody fun. I did not have any expectations with this movie cause of its poor marketing with the trailers. Making the movie seem boring and annoying with Harley Quinn personality. After watching, I was surprised and I loved it.The plot does jump around a lot in the movie. It may not make sense in the first half hour of the movie. The film is narrated by Harley Quinn as she explains certain backstories like Huntress or Renee Montoya. And certain events which all leads up to them meeting up. It is a lot of fun with its narrative structure. Harley (Margot Robbie) is torn up about the break up from Joker. But now many bad guys are after her cause Joker is no longer protecting her. Meanwhile, Cassandra (Ella Jay Basco) pickpockets one of Roman/Black Mask (Ewan McGregor) henchman and stole a diamond that is worth a lot to him. Roman decides to put a bounty on Cassandra which Harley tries to protect her from. Which Renee (Rosie Perez), Huntress (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), and Dinah/ Black Canary (Jurnee Smollett-Bell) try to help her as well.The film is a lot of fun. The direction has its own visual and exciting style that never slows down. All thanks to director Cathy Yan. Which she handled scenes very well and did great with the action sequences. The action and fight sequences are entertaining and exciting. There are some gory scenes with Black Mask henchman skinning a guys face off. Got to remember it is an R rated film. Every fight scene is thrilling and worth watching. The climax taking place in a closed down theme park. Really felt like one awesome carnival ride with watching Harley, Dinah, Renee, and Huntress team up. Which kind of sucks cause they only team up in the climax of the movie. And you kind of want more.The cast ensemble did good with their characters. Margot Robbie is great as Harley. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is great as Huntress and a cross bow assassin with mood swings. Jurnee Smollett-Bell is great as Dinah but she only uses her black canary scream power only once in the movie. Chris Messina playing Roman's bodyguard is creepy. Ella Jay Basco is good playing Cassandra. Ewan McGregor is great as Black Mask. A psychotic and narcissistic villain with a metro personality.The movie is packed with a lot of action, a fun direction, and the soundtrack was also great with the movie as well.Overall, Birds of Prey is an awesome film. They story does jump around with its narrative but if you sit back and enjoy the ride of action and humor. It is worth seeing.






Really enjoyed Birds of Prey. Wasnt that fussed going into it, just went for some entertainment on a Sunday. Not been too impressed with DC films so far, but I did enjoy this. Margot Robbies portayl of Harle Quin is really good and she suits that role to a t. The film has great action with bone snapping fight scenes and excellent projection of the criminally insane. Definitely worth a watch.






After I saw Suicide Squad, I so let down by how bland, tamed and poorly made it was for a movie made of up crazy and heightened characters. Birds of Prey luckily is not that. It is by far a huge improvement with how Harley Quinn and the supporting characters function into the story and tone.After finally breaking free from Jared Leto's Joker (and thankfully he is barely in it), Harley discovers the cost of being free from a toxic relationship with the most feared criminal is now she is no longer protected from every other criminal that wants revenge.Margot Robbie gets to finally make Harley Quinn feel fully realized in her hyper and abstract performance. While Suicide Squid's used flashbacks to show her obssession with the Joker, BOP instead uses her breakup with the clown to explore her sense of indepence in a world that wants her dead, in jail or to be used. The story greatly shows how Quinn's skills of being a former psychologist can be what makes her alienate and infuriating the people around her. Most of Robbie's BOP co-stars get moments to shine thanks to Christina Hodson's screenplay taking the time to explore how each of them deal with living in the toxic, crime-filled world of Gotham. Jurnee Smollet-Bell gives a moral dimension to Black Canary as the daughter of a former superhero trying to lay low. Her character is the closest to being a complete hero but because of a simple nice act to help Harley, she ends up unintentionally as one of Roman Sionus's hired goons. Rosie Perez shines as the veteran cop Renee Montoya whose mission to serve the law feels unsatisfying with her sexist male co-workers looking down on her and putting a strain on the relationship with her district attorney girlfriend. Breakout star Ella Jay Basco as Cassandra Cain serves the emotional center piece very well to help Harley Quinn feel she can be looked up to for once. While I was really wanting more of her on screen, Mary Elizabeth Winstead's Huntress becomes a scene-stealer with what little she gets from the way she brutally takes out criminals with her crossbow to awkward moments of her trying to be social. Ewan McGregor fully embraces how cruel yet also very pathetic his villain Roman Sionus/Black Mask can be. His character's attempt to prove that he is the coolest and most dangerous criminal in Gotham comes off as hilarious a lot of times. Yet there were moments when McGregor takes his performance to terrifying levels when Roman asserts his own power on others that he feels don't respect him in very disturbing ways.Despite Birds of Prey being her second feature film, director Cathy Yan shoots the film with superb confidence and expertise delivering a hyper and frenetic energy that makes all the scenes feel very lively and colorful along with help from cinematographer Mathew Libatique staging the shots to feel very vibrant with specific color choices. And when paired with John Wick director Chad Stahelski as the second-unit to push the quality of the fight choreography to superb, Yan makes the action of Birds of Prey feel very heightened and dirty but still look visually-stunning to watch.Unfortunately the plot is a little convoluted for a very simple story about Harley Quinn. The movie takes a lot of inspiration from the non-chronological narrative of Pulp Fiction and the fourth-wall breaking of Deadpool. While it does work with showing how unreliable Harley is as a narrator, it felt like it breaks the movie's face-paced, energetic flow. While the plot macguffin wasn't a doomsday device like in other comic book movies it still felt really ridiculous with how created large stakes for Gotham. It felt like it acted as a means to get the characters together to form the Birds of Prey yet it also makes their team-up feel like an afterthought. The reshoots on this movie did feel a bit noticeable with unusual scene transitions and certain character motivations. While these were problems I noticed, they were still nowhere near as bad as those issues in Suicide Squad. And BOP achieves what that previous DC anti-hero movie failed at is by embracing the full craziness of Harley Quinn and pairing her with a group of interesting and complex characters.






If you liked Harley Quinn in Suicide Squad, you'll love her in this. The film is very much a Harley Quinn and friends film, BOP doesn't even come into it until the final parts of the film.
Generally enjoyable with some good fight scenes and a bit of comedy






I went into this nervous because what if it's not good because this movie was kind of a big deal for some reason but I should've just been relaxed and just watched it like any other movie. It of course has flaws but also good jokes and action and not superpower stuff. Although I didn't really like how like all men in this movie are bad or are depicted as so but there are obviously some bad women too ( other than main characters) . But overall it was a good time I would recommend it.






It doesn't. I'm a fan of both DC and Marvel. I've been disappointed by so many of these terrible DC movies. This one actually is engaging from beginning to end. A cohesive plot with good characters. It's kind of like Deadpool.






It a perfect comedy action r rated with Harley Quinn movie come entertainment movie If you miss this Birds Of Prey then you don't understand the Madness kind of movie that BOP gave it. I enjoy very much and it totally woman's getting Madness to each other. This movie should call 'The madness of Harley freaking Quinn'






I thought it was a fun movie, don't listen to the hate train or incels who haven't even seen the movie. Huntress stood out to me even though her actual presence in the movie was sort of small. I will say that this seemed like a movie to fill margot's ego, I wanted to see more of the actual BIRDS of prey. Lol






This review is not objective. Just opinionI like this movie. Very much. But it's not because this movie is good, the only reason is Margot Robbie. She is a perfect Harley Quinn and fully revealed this character. She is exactly as she should be.
What about other part of movie... I had a filling that child write scenario like "boys(girls) not allowed' on tree house doors. And there wasn't any good women characters except Harley. Men characters is totally blank and empty too. Just another one evil white guy without good history and charisma.
Some parts of movie was bloody, some of them was fun. But mostly it's pretty boring movie. I wish to seen more Harley Quinn than ' new ghost busters'-level film






The worse of all the dc films , the story is week , the little girl can't act and the baddy is too camp , only the editing the music and the main henchman save this from being a 2 star filmVery poor






The movie is great and especially loved the fourth wall story telling. Margot Robbie is an amazing Harley and definitely deserved to make this movie. Her style in storytelling and having her produce this movie gave this movie a real special treat to it!






The whole movie was alot of fun. Anyone saying otherwise is just a internet killjoy.






In a word? OMFG!!!!In a good- soooooooooooooo good way! Truth be told, I was dreading seeing this movie (I took my mum to see it, this afternoon), thinking it'd be 109 mins of rampant misandry.I was the only male in the screening, 2 others came in as the film started- one walked out (I think he snuck in anyway). In total there were 7 people at the show. But boy, did that guy who walked out- miss out!!! BoP is, by far, the most satisfying first-watch of DC movies, next to BvS (My #1 of all time). Like BvS, I really can't understand where all the hate for this is coming from?!BoP's like a mash-up of "Crank", "Death Proof", "Sucker Punch", "Deadpool 2", "Suicide Squad" (It has that Snyder/Ayer aesthetic to it- nice little references to Suicide Squad, btw), and Walter Hill's "The Warriors", without feeling derivative of either or any!Go see this movie without political agenda or purism for the source material and be prepared to have your mind B-L-O-W-N! The soundtrack ROCKS and fits the frenetic, hyper-kinetic visuals to a tee!Cathy Yan is a talent to be reckoned with!I had a BLAST (I'm still catching my breath).






This is a fantastic, empowering, hilarious movie. The fight scenes are to die for; graphic and beautiful at the same time. Every character shines and is well developed.
Ewan McGregor is just perfect.
It's a movie for this age.






At its core, Birds of Prey is a movie about the best breakfast sandwich a girl can get in Gotham City. Margot Robbie gives a spectacular performance in her return to Harley Quinn and, as a comic book fan, she is everything I could have wished for in this infamous role.Director Cathy Yan managed to make the film's nonlinear timeline flow naturally with Harley's creative narration, entertaining stop-frames, and the overall quirky pacing. There were moments where the story lagged, but even in those slower moments, the movie proved to be entertaining.Birds of Prey was a colourful carnival ride of carnage. It had fantastical costumes, a rendition of "Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend" featuring Ewan McGreggor (um, yes please!), an abandoned amusement park battle set to Heart's "Barracuda", and plenty of ball bashing.Jurnee Smollett-Bell was stunning as the beloved Dinah Lance and I look forward to the day that we meet this Black Canary's Oliver Queen. Mary Elizabeth Winstead's Huntress was a fantastic take on the character. I adored her awkward approach to Helena, in particular the scene where she rehearsed what she planned to say in front of her bathroom mirror. All across the board the characters felt relatable, even in their extremes.How can we not love a movie filled with badass women that was written, direct, and produced by women? This is one girl gang that I'd love to join. There was so much about this film that I loved. It was fun, quirky, and unique. It left me hopeful for the future of these characters in the DCEU.P.S. When you go to the polls this year, don't forget that Harley Quinn voted for Bernie.
First of all I apologize for the spoilers but to give the right review it requires that I include them. Secondly I apologize about the length of this review but I just have a lot to say. This movie was one of the most overall entertaining movies I've seen in the past year or two. Let me tell you why and I'll start with the small stuff. Costumes, hair and makeup, set direction. The colors in this movie are used for a reason. They reflect Harley Quinn's personality. She's glittery and funny and exploding with character. She's a "colorful" character. It also fits with the fun female aspect of the movie which a lot of people complained about. I wouldn't really call it a feminist movie. But even if it was why is that a problem?? You don't have to agree with the feminist movement but it's extremely relevant right now. So many movies are focused on macho men. A lot of times overly muscled and shirtless for no real reason other than SEXUALIZING MEN. A female-led cast is very refreshing and fun and I hope we see more of this in pop culture in the near future and for a long time coming. One thing I thought was interesting is that I didn't think they overly sexualized the women. At least not as much as they could have. The plot wasn't focused on sexual relationships and there was no nudity which I kind of expected there to be. Some people complained that it was all about beating up men. I agree that that theme is seen throughout the movie. Making all the men out to be bad guys that use and betray women. But I think that fit for a movie that is driven by girl power. That's how it should be. That's the fit of the genre so anybody complaining about that is an idiot that's missing the obvious point. The movie is about women that are used by men who think they own them. It's about women that are looked over and treated as lesser than. It's not like that in all of modern society but it does happen and that needs to be talked about. It needs to be exposed. These women in the movie got revenge on the men who wronged them just like any woman OR MAN would and should want to. Harley was right when she said that SHE was the one Gotham should fear. She didn't need Mr. J to protect her and she proves that throughout the movie. So don't complain that it's some sort of feminist movement statement because even if it is that doesn't mean it isn't a good movie!! Next point. The humor. The humor was consistent throughout the movie and I never really felt any cringe moments. I enjoyed the humorous narration. I enjoyed the slapstick violence humor that is seen throughout action comedies with both men and women. The use of language was done well even if there could've been less of it but who really cares?? Margot's facial expressions were brilliant!! Far better than in Suicide Squad. The whole getting Cass to crap the diamond out was a little juvenile but the choice to swallow it was made by......you guessed it, A KID. Next. The costumes. Harley's costumes were great and also fit her character and personality. The only thing I would say is that her clothes were constantly changing between almost every scene which was slightly confusing but also just a part of the movie. It was really big deal in the long run. And they weren't overly revealing. Next point. The set decoration was fun, colorful, and well thought out. It also was another aspect that reflected Harley's personality. Next. The action was so much fun and very well choreographed. The violence was intense and fun as well and added some dark humor. The cinematography was superb. Camera angles and visual sequences were mostly seamless with a few exceptions with video editing that were only slightly distracting. I loved this movie and I think they did so much right. Now I'll get to the few things I didn't like which were the only reason I gave this a 9 and not a 10. The casting of Ewan McGregor didn't sit right with me. He's a brilliant actor but I didn't believe him as a villain. I would've loved to see someone like James McAvoy or Jeremy Renner. The other thing is that despite a strong female cast some of the dramatic acting was a little weak for just 2 or 3 characters. That's something I can look past. Some people complained about the jumping around in time but they did that for a reason. They wanted to only give you information piece by piece to bring it all together later on. Not a rare format of movie and very enjoyable when done right. Really not sure why people complained about the music. I thought that all the music fit the movie and the specific scenes they were used for. I especially loved the fight scene with "Barracuda" playing in the background. I really hope Margot Robbie snags a Golden Globe for this or at least a nomination. She was brilliant and absolutely hilarious. Don't listen to people complaining about this movie. I think this is the new direction of comic book action comedies and I like this direction as long as they continue to do it the right way. The ending implies sequels that I really look forward to. Remember that this is not a Harley Quinn origins movie so if that's what you're looking for you won't find it here. It's of course, as named, a Birds of Prey origins story. You can say that it's just a set up for the future but I think it was important to have a thorough explanation of how they met and how they banded together. It ensures that we know the basis of their relationships. For those that complained about it and gave it 1 star. My guess is you already knew what you were getting into when you decided to see it so don't be morons. If it wasn't for you I get that but sometimes you just have to take a movie for what it is without bias. This was an all around fantastic movie even if it wasn't perfect. I had lots of fun. Oh and one other thing....I'm NOT a woman ;)
Birds of Prey continues DC winning streak and cementing DC and WB as movie studios allowing directors to bring their own vision to the table and going all out. This movie could easily have been PG-13 minus a few violent fight scenes but the fact that the studio didn't bother to alter them to PG-13 is awesome. Now coming to the movie I liked for the most part and was conflicted when it comes to a few areas.
The movie can be called a sequel to Suicide Squad which focuses on Harley Quinn after she broke up with the Joker. Now why the movie is called Birds of Prey I don't know because Harley Quinn is definitely the front and centre and the other characters shows up from time to time and team up towards the end. The movie is told completely through Harley Quinn perspective and is narrated by her thus the sequences of event that happened in the movie are a little out of sequence showing the chaos in her mind, It shows very well the chaos in Harley Quinn's mind but I think kills the excitement and build-up of a few scenes. The comedy is very quirky and organic which I love in contrast to the one forced upon. The action scenes are very well done and are exciting except for the last action sequence, It didn't do much for me and I was feeling bored towards the end of the movie.
The cinematography was great and some sequence really popped, the soundtrack was great as well.
The actors here have done a phenomenal job especially Margot Robbie, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Ewan Mcgregor and Chris Messina.
Margot Robbie is the definitive Harley Quinn and each of her sequences lifted the movie. Ewan did a great job although I wished I had seen something more from the character than we got. Huntress was an interesting character but we didn't get much in this movie and Victor Zsasz was menacing.
In all I really liked the movie except maybe the last 20 minutes, I am excited to see Harley Quinn and Birds of Prey in future movies.






I will start off this review with the positive aspects first such as: Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn was a great casting and continues to be where I think she gives a better performance then her one in Suicide Squad, and Ewan Mcgregor plays a decent version of Black Mask. The use of colours and costumes I thought were great and I found some moments of entertainment through some of its action sequences.
You started well in the beginning but when you lose my interest from the middle of movie then you seem not to care for the movie anymore that you want to see the ending right away.
There is no Birds of prey, at least none recognizable from their source material counterparts. A dud from Warner Bros. Rosie Perez who is a walking cliche' as Renee Montoya (and I know that's what they were going for but it just doesn't work}, and Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Huntress who gives us some very cringey at times acting, and I think some of this has something to do with the screenplay which I also think is average at best.The action was lacking and uninspired as well. It relied way too much on slow-mo fights or just too much going on to really understand it all. You know you have a poorly made fight sequence when they decide to use slow motion on every punch or hit to make it seem cooler than it is.
They also butchered Victor Zsasz which I found extremely disappointing as I was looking forward to his inclusion in the DCEU. The story is told out of order, which would work if it had an interesting one. The portrayal of the characters was somewhat adequate.
The best thing about suicide squad was Robbie's performance but this vehicle is a disservice to the potential that was there. Robbie does her best but the direction, script and editing are not at the requisite level. An interesting character poorly treated by a very lacklustre script. Disappointing.When a cartoon does better than a multi-million dollar film, you've failed.






It seems like DCEU has found the correct path if their intention is to continue the MCU type shared universe.Speaking of the movie, I really enjoy the entire movie.There are good action sequences through out the movie with the killer soundtrack which I really enjoy. The soundtrack is really great.It is one of the plus points of the movie. And the best thing is Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn. Its literally the fantabulous emancipation of one (and only) Harley Quinn. May be the main title of the movie about Birds of prey. But to me its more about Harley Quinn, the anti heroine. That doesn't mean its bad, not at all.Using well established crowd loving character to build up a all women super team is a great idea. Plus all other characters also portrayed well by the actressesI didnt talk about the villain (or the villains) didnt I? Thats the biggest problem I found out in the movie. If Black Mask could have been a little bit challenging to the not yet established group of young (in experience for some of them) heroines, the movie would have been perfect. So far in the DCEU, the villains devision has been good.They are worthy villains for the heroes(except steppenwolf for Superman). Otherwise the movie is worth for your time. Plus being R rated doesn't hurt the movie in fact it fit with the tone of the DC characters.






This film is one of the most recent of DC taking a different approach to its films, albeit on the extreme end- from dark and dull to insane and frenetic energy that leaves you bouncing off the walls way after the credits ended.I found the fight scenes to be fun and somehow hilarious in parts, and they were excellently choreographed and shot- each fight bought something different into the mix.All the actors and actresses did a great job- Margot Robbie steals the show with her amazing performance of Harley Quinn, and Ewan McGregor makes a fantastically evil antagonist. Even the side characters are interesting, not bland and bringing in some elements of the comic from which they originated.I'm no film critic, but as an ordinary consumer, this film has started my 2020 off with a blast and I look forward to seeing what DC does next with these characters.






Margot Robbie killed it as Harley Quinn. She was the best part of the whole movie. Cast was amazing. Good job DC another win. Loved this movie.






I really enjoyed watching this movie. It is a lot better then I expected it to be because of the hype and how disjointed Suicide Squad was. But Harley Quinn is so much fun so seeing it from her mind means bouncing around like a terrier after a ball. And you don't have to have seen SS because everything is covered, a few times.
And I think some people have misunderstood the title and thought this was a team movie with Harley joining the team, it isn't. Harley makes the Birds of Prey team happen, setting up future movies the way Batman VS Superman introduce Wonder Woman and her 2nd movie is now (FINALLY) coming out. DC Entertainment isn't run by stupid people and movies like this are meant to help push a story along as well and tell it's own story and the thing it does best, Entertain. I expect to see the Birds of Prey heroes in future movies even if Harley isn't in them.
There are a lot of Justice League stories, I'm a fan of the Dark Magic heroes myself and I'm hoping to see their story with all the other Justice League stories in the future.
I plan to see this movie again, I think it is worth paying twice to see because there is so much to see.






Loved it. Not your standard superhero story. Sure it was slightly slow at times but the payoff in the end was great. And MR was fantastic as HQ again. Loved it.

Ok, let's be honest about this: yes, it's a Harley freakin' Quinn movie, so the main title is definitely on the wrong side. but the other birds added up to the kickass, as they should have, though i loved black canary here more. then, let me be more honest about another thing: i never have thought we actually needed a HQ movie. Robbie was right when she said she was just scratching the surface of our "Daddy's Little Monster". you'll see a crazier, thus, more literally comical HQ in BoP. McGregor as Black Mask was weighty. he killed his scenes where the audience should be hit right at their un-comfort zone; hence, a convincing villain. the action scenes, for me, gave the movie a snatch up. you don't even have to bring a popcorn--let the visuals serve themselves. for me, the real emancipation they pulled off here is from the clutter of its predecessor film.






Anarchic and cathartic, Birds of Prey does exactly what you expect it to. Bubblegum violence and a great score keep the energy up throughout. It's entertaining as all hell, and as far from wholesome as it's possible to be; it's definitely worth the indulgence.






Hello friends let me say something, ok ? Yes it is a messy movie but it is because its Harley Queen's story she is the narrator ! And that makes a messy movie a fine one from my opinion. From the last movies that Dc had put up I say from WW and Justice League Green Lantern Joker 2019 and this one They are coming back 4 real. 10/10 for my childhood and for DC keep it up this way !






MY NON SPOILER REVIEW 🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭
As for my opinion, I thought it's going to be a not so good movie but I was wrong , it was freaking GREAT.The fight scenes are well executed, it really shows the #Girlpower of the team.I love how Margot Robbie portrays Harley Quinn in this movie than #SuicideSquad I think no one will ever top that and damn she's gorg!!.The way they told the story is so fun to watch, they didn't do it in the usual setup, Which kinda new and cool.I love how they didn't change the fact that Harley Quinn is not a hero type and they stick to that material.honestly I even more like it than Aquaman (love them both anw) overall its a solid 9/10 for me. a MUST watch DC film.






This movie is just an all around entertaining experience with Margot Robbie crushing it as Harley Quinn. The action sequences were thrilling, but the movie also included some great comedic scenes. Just go in the movie to have fun and not to be critical and you'll have a blast!






I got a weird impression from the trailer and kind of went in thinking I wouldn't like it, I don't know why I ever even doubted that I would love Harley! Maybe it's because I went in with low expectations, but I loved it!






Really fun movie with badass female leads! Lots of action with a cute feminine touch!






I'm a DC and Harley fan. The cinematography and the way the story is told by Harley is excellent. The story and action was good. The continuity with the previous DC movies is also good. Lots of references to the comics.
The violence and language is excessive. This is a comic book movie. Kids and teens are going to want to see this movie. Most conversations use the f-word alot. How can a movie with good writing not have better dialogue?
The violence agaisnt innocent families makes you wish the scenes would just end.
Cassandra's character was a complete disappointment. She becomes Orphan in the comics and is an amazing fighter- with a better backstory than you get in BOP.






Yesterday I saw alot of negative reviews wich made me rethink if I should see the film at cinema or not. I decided that I will go and give it a try the film is so good, fun and happy so ignore all the negative reviews and give it a try.






Comedy-Adventure. Exactly what is says it is, nothing more nothing less.






Tbh I didn't expect much from this movie . But it was pretty good. After Wonder Woman and Shazam , DCEU finally seems to be headed in the right direction.What I liked about the movie:*Margot Robbie owns it as Harley Quinn*Mary Elizabeth Winstead is the MVP of this movie*Cinematography is visually pleasing*The Set design and costume designs are good* The music's really good* Good stunt choreography*Fun and entertainingWhat I didn't like -* Uneven storytelling , it gets confusing at times*Rosie Perez as Renee Montoya . Black Mask is sometimes disappointing ( If you know him from comics)*The ending was weak
This is a nice comic book movie with great action and humor. The story line and script was good and the fight sequences were enjoyable. Although some of the story line seem rushed and convenient, it is forgivable due to the time constraints.Margot Robbie was top notch in this movie with great humor, narration, controlled madness and great action choreography delivery. It would have been easy to go over-the-top and over-act, but she did a really good job making the character likeable.Although the movie is ultra-feminist and male-bashing, it fits the movie theme as it is like how Harley Quinn would see the world after being abused, abandoned and gone-mad by the chauvinistic and selfish Joker.In terms of the action, it was really good, fluid and sleek. But I wished it more to John Wick's level of action cinematography, editing and sound effects, which would have made it perfect. Margot Robbie and Mary Elizabeth Winstead seems to express the action scenes well, but Jurnee Smollett-Bell actions fighting shots seem poorly framed, edited and choreographed which made it look amateurish. Not too sure whether she was not as prepared or not, but this should have been able to be compensated with camera and editing master craft.In terms of the acting, all was well done, but when the ladies get together, there seem to a lack of chemistry or bonding, which made it feel a bit awkward. Mary Elizabeth Winstead was serious and less expressive while Rosie Perez, at times, looked out of place, probably due to lack of character development or poor transition from cop to vigilante. Ewan Mcgregor did not seem the most fitting for his role in this movie to me, but I might be biased (type-casting) by his previous movie/series roles I have watched.Overall, I would recommended for you to watch it in the cinema now.






This movie makes want more from the cast and the action scenes are great and EWAN MCGREGOR kills it as BLACK MASK he's the best villain in DC yet to see don't listen to haters listen to your heart go see Birds Of Prey and sed the emancipation yourself 💯






This movie is a MUST SEE especially for women. You'll get it when you see it.






The best comic adaptation since Wonder Woman.
Decidedly not your typical superhero movie. Margot Robbie is riveting as Harley Quinn, dropping moments of clear-eyed perception into her ongoing madness. If anything, the title and subtitle should have been reversed - this is really Harley Quinn's movie. Ewan McGregor has the campy adversary down; all the supporting roles are well done and the visual wildness makes for a unique experience. Ignore the haters, get out of your comfort zone and lick it up!
Margo Robbie was amazing as usual. My only disappointment was the poor use of Black Canary and Huntress. Hopefully in future installment they will make better use of the characters.






My wife does not understand the DC Universe.
Even the animated "Harley Quinn" Series , doesn't impress her in any way?But with this helpfull introduction of Huntress, Black Canary and what I think is Barbara Gordon or Kate Kane, the wife managed to understand a bit more about this universe.She's now finally started the "Batwoman" seriesMe: I was entertained by my favorite DC Universe , regardless of the faulty timelines, Earth, and age I think this is a great family movie . My daughter liked it too;-)






I loved the movie. Margot Robbie is such a great actress and nailes the Harley Quinn character.






It was a lot of fun. The action scenes were very colorful and well paced with really cool animation and sound effects at times. It was visually like Natural Born Killers, but with a clearer tone.






Birds of prey was a pretty good fun movie. It's nice to see DC continuing it's good form after the disastrous BvS and Suicide Squad.






For the most part, i enjoyed this film. It had some really funny bits, some brutal fight scenes and a good cast. Wasn't massively keen on the man-hating, albeit it wasn't quiet as bad as i'd heard. Not the best DC film ever, but far from being the worst






This is kind of like a female version of the Joker movie, but not quite as interesting. Joker did something very different from most comic book movies in its structure because it was focused on character and not "good vs evil" plot with random object chasing. This one has a very typical Marvel-type plot where there is a bad guy who wants a diamond.The first third of the movie where we get a real introduction to Harley and she acts truly crazy was great. The middle third was ok. The end had some great action, but was also mostly just a beat em up "grande finale" that are so typical of these movies. I know Hollywood isn't usually willing to take a leap and switch this story. I was just hoping for something a little bit more interesting.I did have a hard time believing that a 100lb woman could kick the crap out of multiple 250 lb men. So it is basically a fantasy movie. And the fantasy is that women kick the crap out of men. It's not really subtle at all. It would have been more interesting to me if she had outsmarted them in some way. But instead they just present the story like an episode of the A-Team, where the crew punches out or shoots several hundred bad guys. Basically these women behave just like men in every action movie. They would be interchangeable with men.Overall a decent start to the franchise. Maybe the next one will take more chances.
Movie with really good action and good story. Little slow start but it gets good. final act was kinda dumb and average but rest was really good and funny. Ewan did excellent job as the main antagonist. Rest of the characters were kinda thrown aside yo focus more on Harley even tho some of them had interesting backgrounds. If those characters get own movies (at least some of them) i'd say this movie could be 8/10 maybe even 9/10 depending how they do them






Birds of Prey is an entertaining film that is bogged down by a disjointed, uninteresting and simplistic story. The basic premise is that Harley Quinn is tasked with finding an important diamond for Black Mask within a certain amount of time. Along her adventure audiences are introduced to new characters like Black Canary, Huntress, Victor Zaszz, etc. Margot Robbie excellently portrays Harley Quinn once again and absolutely steals the show. Her comedic wit and performance embodies the fan favorite character perfectly. Ewan Mcgreggor does a great job with the material he was given for Black Mask but ultimately the character didn't feel like his comic book counter part. The same can be said for the rest of The Birds of Prey. Although all the actors do a decent job, their characters are not too memorable or likeable especially compared to the comic book versions. There brief origin stories are to blame due to random flashbacks, brief conversations, and lack of screen time since we follow Harley Quinn for most of the film. The action doesn't disappoint thanks to the John Wick's stunt choreographer's contribution but there were some scenes that are hard for some to suspend disbelief... Black Canary, Huntress, and Harley Quinn beating thugs is one thing but Renee Montoya bearing a 6 ft 200lb thug one on one is too unrealistic even for a superhero film. If you enjoy superhero action movies you won't be disappointed with Birds of Prey. However, if you were hoping for a more team based superhero movie with amazing depictions of other characters besides Harley Quinn, then you will be hard pressed to get that here.






Margot Robbie is brilliant but this character is off the wall (everything is in hyperbole in a screechy, high pitched, New York accent). Much of the storytelling is done inside out (flashbacks to establish the backstories of the ladies). The supporting performances by the Birds of Prey are good and the casting is perfect. Lots of violence and gore, although, I thought the fight choreography is spectacular, especially in the final sequences (I realize this is a minority opinion). All in all the movie was loud and chaotic, the writing and dialogue left a lot to be desired, but the characters were interesting. I give this film a 6 (fair) out of 10. {Super/Anti-Heroes}






Birds of Prey is a fun-house ride, a sassy chick-flick for the dudes and a stylish romp that comes together with Margot Robbie reprising her Harley Quinn scene-stealing role. It's exaggerated and violent (like every good action picture) but with incredible use of color and style and spot-on incorporation of tunes. The stunts are fantastic and done really well. Margot Robbie continues to improve her star power by amping up the wattage here; Ewan McGregor has a boat-load of fun with his Black Mask character; and the rest of the posse of girls has just enough to do to keep them in the picture, although I don't think they were as fleshed-out as they could have been. I loved this picture as did the vast majority of the audience in the theatre when I saw it. I don't think the marketing did the movie justice, unfortunately, and the title is ridiculously long when it doesn't need to be. And yes, the editing makes it overly confusing going back and forth until finally settling into the story. But it's a riotous mess that ultimately works. Take a bunch of friends and get your popcorn -- this is a great action flick if ever there was one.






I really loved everything about this movie but I belive its becasue I didnt have the same expectations as some people did. If you go in thinking it's a Birds Of Prey movie I can see how you would be sadly disappointed. But I never once saw it as a Birds Of Prey movie its Harley Quinn's movie with some side action of the Birds Of Prey. But for being basically just a Harly Quinn movie it does it very well.






First of all, I'm sorry because my bad grammar.
secondly, this is my personal review. And I just want to give a suggest for the next movie from DC. Cause I'm DC Fanboy!!!!
Thirdly, I gave a score of 7, because I have divided the overall score.Back to the movie review. And I think it have spoiler.The battle scenes that were shown were not very good. from what was shown, it was very apparent that the battle was made up. I was very impressed for the acrobatic action of Ms. Margot, and also the stuntman. but that doesn't make the battle look good. from a group of men who fall easily because of a woman's punch, to a woman who can fend off the punch of a man who wants to kill her.the story is too straight, looks like if birds of prey is a superman movie. which, it's very easy to bring down enemies. and once again I say, the action looks contrived.and the jokes made by Harley, are very lacking. he used the break the 4th wall technique, but it wasn't as good as deadpool in making his punchline.
I laughed, but only grinned. not LOL. But in the end in post credit scene, I LOL.
It's conceivable that Hollywood has gone woke lately especially with #metoo movements. Birds of Prey doesn't really go down that path, its more just a kick ass female superhero flick. It has killa action sequences with equally matched soundtracks.Set after Suicide Squad, Joker and Harley Quinn (Robbie) are quits. Harley has independence but Gotham wants her dead. Through circumstances she's involved with Gothams Roman "Black Mask" Sionis (Mcgregor) who desperately is after the Bertinelli Diamond, which was pick pocketed by Cassandra Cain. The diamond in question is named after the gunned down family whose daughter survives and becomes the "Huntress". Together with Black Canary (singer in Romans club) and a down and out cop Renee Montoya they form Birds of Prey to protect Cassandra from Black Mask.A lot to take in......well this is the films issue, it is quite disjointed in places and sometimes doesn't have clear direction for the audience to follow. In many ways though its better than its predecessor. However it's Margot's film she is excellent once again using her sassiness with ease. It's not as bad as people are saying.
I think that many people will agree with me ,that this film doesnt feel like birds of prey film more like harley quinn spin off and that is some of problems with this film,film focuces to little on side characters which is shame since they are intersting as much as harley,but they are also some positive staff like some jokes were funny and margot is great again as harley and lets not forget ewan who was very enteteining villain,birds of prey defienetly took some inspiration from deadpool but it wasnt able to make it as good as mentioned film above,birds of prey isnt the best dceu film but it isnt also the worster one,i would say this film is enteteining but with some noticable flaws






Just walked in from seeing it. Thought it was ok. Took way too long to get the team together. A woke movie? Just because it stars women and was mostly made by women doesn't make it woke. I'm a male and didn't find anything I would call male bashing. There are thousands of movies where the males are bad guys. My main issue was the story was not very good. I liked the soundtrack. The action scenes were good and the acting was mostly good. 7/10 sounds right to me. And I see no need for a sequel. Once again DC just can't compare to Marvel






What started off poorly with Suicide Squad and evolved over the course of Aquaman and Shazam seems to have finally blossomed into the DCEU's new style of acid trip levels of color, fun action but a still lacking experience that somehow still feels like they're actively chasing Marvel.Birds of Prey is basically the female DC version of Deadpool. Lots of narration, comedy violence and murder and a healthy dash of fourth wall breaking. It's slick, stylized and has some really cool action scenes here and there along with some legit laughs.Robbie, Winstead and McGregor all seem to be having a blast too and I think that really shows at points. That's not to say the rest of the cast is bad, they're not, they just don't shine like those three.Unfortunately, it doesn't feel like there was much attention paid to... Things making sense. It jumps around in time, personalities switch on a dime, we go from slapstick to brutality in an instant and there's a number of just random things that pop up, not even all McGuffins, that feel like someone just hitting a randomizer. Now, Harley narrates the whole thing and maybe this erratic style is meant to reflect her own personal brand of crazy but it does feel off at times.There's also a supper not subtle message in here about female empowerment, which is great, that's an important topic, but could there be a single male in this world that isn't a terrible person? Not asking for a saint or savior here, just one dude that's not awful. I mean even Black Panther has Martin Freeman!All in all, it's a fun watch. I wasn't checking the time in my seat, it wasn't as salacious as I thought it could be (that's a pro and further proof that women shoot women different than men). It's fun. It's trying to be more than that though and I don't think it gets there. Deadpool worked because it knew what it was and stuck with that, Birds of Prey wants to be more and I think it overreaches and that leaves it feeling a little hollow.






I saw "Birds of Prey:and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn", starring Margot Robbie-Bombshell, Suicide Squad; Rosie Perez-The Dead Don't Die, Pineapple Express; Mary Elizabeth Winstead-Gemini Man, 10 Cloverfield Lane; Jurnee Smollett_Bell-True Blood_tv, Friday Night Lights_tv and Ewan McGregor-Doctor Sleep, the Star Wars movies.
This is an all female group of crime fighters in Gotham City that take up the slack when Batman is nowhere to be found. Margot/Harley Quinn has broken up with the Joker and found some new best friends in Rosie/Renee Montoya, a Gotham police detective, Mary/The Huntress, a crime boss's daughter turned vigilante and Jurnee/Black Canary, a singer in Ewan's night club that can hit some pretty high notes when she wants to. Ewan/Black Mask is the local crime boss that wants a special diamond that has fallen into the hands of a local 12 year old female pick pocket named Cassandra Cain-in the comics, she is an excellent fighter on the level of Batman himself, but here, she is just a pick pocket-and Ewan has a whole army out looking for her. Now I must mention that I am a big comics fan-I still collect them-and some people will gripe about certain things that are not exactly like they are in the comics but that's the way things go sometimes when they make adaptations. As long as the story keeps you entertained-and this one does-that should be all that matters. Ewan is great as an egotistical madman and the females all get their place in the spotlight. I have heard-depending on the box office it makes, of course-that this might be part of a 3 movie deal. There is a lot of kick-ass action and humor and although there is no scene after the end credits, there is a funny voice over from Margot so don't leave too early.
It's rated "R" for strong violence, language, drug content and sexual content-no nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 49 minutes.
I liked it enough that I would buy it on DVD.
Up front I will admit there are some problems but overall it is a fun action movie with a diverse cast. There are some amazing fight scenes throughout the movie. The casting of Black Canary and Huntress are perfect. The only bad thing I have to say about Huntress was she didn't get enough air time. McGregor was a fun full rounded villain. He seemed to really enjoy the randomness crazy that Black Mask can bring to each scene he's in.
I hope word of mouth helps to give it a sequel. As I feel now that the characters know one another skip the downside that a orgin story can sometimes bring and see how they now work as a team.






I'm a big fan of original birds of prey comic books and was disappointed that they have changed the story and omitted certain core members like Barbara Gordon / Oracle so I had low expectations for this movie originally. However, I was totally blown away after watching it today. It was incredibly entertaining and kept my eyes glued to the screen the whole time. Margot Robbie really brought Harley Quinn to life!






After many months of anticipation Birds Of Prey is finally with us and I have seen it and this is my review for the film. The premise of the film sees Harley Quinn break up with The Joker which alerts a criminal head honcho who aims to take advantage of her and a group of other women in Gotham City.
Main Character
Even though this film is called Birds Of Prey it should really just be called a Harley Quinn film and Margot Robbie is fantastic in this film. It is clear that they are trying to make her the DC version of Deadpool and she is very charismatic in the role and has some really good lines in the film, I feel like she has a real good grip on this character and it feels like she really enjoys playing the role of Harley Quinn.
Supporting Characters
Ewan McGregor plays Roman Sionis AKA The Black Mask in this film and it is clear that he is having a blast in this role, his character is very charismatic and a bit off the wall but that works because of the film that he is in and he is definitley an entertaining villain in this film. Now we get to the rest of the Birds Of Prey - Rosie Perez as Renee Montoya, Mary Elizabeth Winestead as The Huntress & Jurnee Smollet-Bell, they all do their best in their roles especially in the action scenes but they just aren't given enough to do in the film. I didn't really care about their characters and I think this was because there backstories are choppily presented and not given as much screen time as Harley Quinn is clearly presented as the most important character in the film.
Story
This film has an interesting story when it comes to Harley's story, it deals with how she is dealing with her situation with The Joker and dealing with being a bit of a better person and I thought that was handled pretty well. But as mentioned before all the other characters stories and motivations aren't really explored enough to make you care and give them a real reason for being a part of this group.
Script
This film has some funny lines and dialogue in the film especially when the film is doing its best to break the fourth wall and be a bit more interesting then many comic book films. Some of the drama is okay but it doesn't really hit the levels that I think it was going for and as mentioned previously it doesn't elevate any of the supporting characters above being okay characters.
Style
This film has a really unique style. the action scenes are fantastic, really fun and unique. The film does a great job of showcasing the characters different fighting styles to create some meorable and really fun action sequences. However, the pacing of the film is a bit messy, the film jumps all over the place which I get was a stylistic choice but it becomes a bit jarring as you are interested to new characters often and the film isn't in order so it can make it a bit hard to follow.
Overall
Overall this film reminds me quite a bit of Suicide Squad which is why it gets the same rating, an above average film that could have done with focusing up a bit more and showed the group together more and interacting. But this is a fun time at the movies and if you don't take this film too seriously then it can be an enjoyable watch for sure.






Nice movie ,everyone goes to watch this movie one timr






Considering Suicide Squad is my most favorite movie ever made, I was really looking forward this movie to come out! I adore Margot Robbie and especially this role of Harley Queen. She really has that crazy but sexy vibe like that character should be. Birds of prey has great action scenes and one funny story and the most important thing is that while I was watching this movie, there wasn't one single moment when I've wondered like: "Oh, when is this movie gonna end?" This stuff really keeps attention from beginning to the end! 9 stars only because it always can be more good and there are really rarely perfect perfect movies. 😂






The upward trend of the quality of DCEU films continues with Birds Of Prey. With some great movies such as Wonder Woman and Shazam!, they've hit a new height. A big reason for this is Margot Robbie's performance as Harley Quinn. She encapsulates the character brilliantly, switching from slightly depressed to absolutely crazy on a dime. The pacing is kinda all over the place, and while that's usually not a good thing, it fits this movie and the tone perfectly. The film also oozes style and contains some frantic editing, which again, fits right in.Ewan McGregor as Roman Sionis, aka the Black Hood, is the best villain of the DCEU so far. He's charismatic but menacing and you're never quite sure what he's going to do next. I got basically everything I wanted from this movie. Humour, great action sequences, very nice cinematography, costumes and production design. It's as in your face as a Harley Quinn movie should be. The supporting cast, the birds of prey, all put in good performances too. Any movie with a fight scene set to 'Barracuda' by Heart is gonna be a win in my book.






I'm over sixty, and generally don't care for characters with no redeeming virtues (my dislike of Watchmen and The Boys is never-ending), so I didn't really expect to connect with Harley Quinn, who is one psychotic charnel house of emotional upheaval. But (surprise surprise) I did -- and found a soft spot within myself for the prickly and over-dramatic Huntress, the hard-drinking cop, and the collaborator-like Black Canary. OK, I even liked the sleazy kid. Like. Not pity (although all of them engendered pity in some way). I liked them. And appreciated the quirky drive of the narrative, and didn't even mind the occasional timeline jumps that took me unawares. The tacky clothing didn't bug me. The black lipstick didn't bug me. The omg over the top accent didn't even bug me. And I was jammin' to the hip-hop hard-driving rap soundtrack, even though I normally dislike rap (hip hop's not terrible. mostly). Even the violence and gore was somewhat entertaining, especially when directed at those who deserved it most. All in all -- a fun ride. Almost a chick flick. A psychotic, hyper-violent chick flick. FUN!






I'll admit I didn't care about the movie, I only went to the cinema to watch Margot Robbie doing stuff. And Margot Robbie is too beautiful to exist as usual, but she is also a very good actress and in this film she proves it once again. In fact she is the focal point of the plot and she is able to carry a lot of the weight of the movie very convincingly and her Harley Quinn is a fun character that manages to entertain. Other than that the film is very simple, the plot is pretty standard and the only particularity is that it is told with different time jumps. The side characters are barely ok, no one apart from Harley is interesting enough to care for him/her or to root against. Finally the action is good for the entire movie but I found the first part of the last fight a bit confusing and hyperkinetic. To describe badly "Birds of Pray: and a title that is too long" is a mixture of a bit of Deadpool and a bit of Kill Bill without the personality of both of them, super colourful and messier. And no I'm not saying that Tarantino and this film are in some way comparable, or even Deadpool, but I think these two movies were a strong inspiration to this one.
I spent my money with the intent of reminding myself how incredibly gorgeous Margot Robbie is and that aspect was present so this movie has reached his goal for me. But furthermore, I found myself a bit entertained and due to its simplicity and humor it's probable that it will entertain you as well.






I actually enjoyed this movie a lot! It was way better then Suicide squad! I actually liked all of the characters! I kinda wished if the movie was longer but it was extremely fun! Highly recommended!






Trust me when I say I hate the woke brigade, the PC and snowflake culture, and the way it's infecting film and TV is so sad, and when people are saying that Birds of Prey is "woke, man-hating trash", it's makes me think did they even see the movie?Cause Birds of Prey hasn't been touched by PC wokeness. It is just a hugely entertaining, extremely R-rated romp with fun characters, dazzling visuals and bone-crunching fight choreography! Not to mention it's filled with wicked performances, charm and lots of laughs.I love DC right now and they need to continue down this path of zany, goofy superhero antics, much like Shazam and Aquaman boasted.






I can't get over how good Birds of Prey was.You just do not expect the Harley Quinn solo vehicle to be the one to show an original take on the Batman universe. It's more than just Margot Robbie's Deadpool (although it is mostly that). It's an effortlessly girl powered action movie with a solid bulk of stunts and martial arts action.Margot Robbie has created a larger than life character who seems to have mild super powers. Harley is complex and kind of scummy but has an admirable love of a good breakfast sandwich (the movie's funniest bit) and exudes a raw athleticism as she shoots cops with a riot gun and whacks goons with a hammer.The first act is a little rocky and watching obsessed Harley go through a breakup starts the movie on a downbeat. But once the other characters the movie becomes a charmingly fast-paced action sit-com. The rest of the cast are great particularly Jurnee Smollett-Bell as Black Canary and a surprisingly agile Rose Perez.This is the direction I'd like to see the DC universe go in. Instead of trying to be over serious, the Batman universe could be fun martial arts flicks (with roller skating and bullet proof corsets).






Joker is a good movie. This a better movie. It has a great acting. It also has a great story line. See it. It is a really good movie. It is one the best movie of 2020. See it. It is a great movie.






Lmfao, there are like only 100 10 star reviews and they're all from brain dead losers, you know a movie is bad when the 10 star reviews end






I really enjoyed this movie. It was fun and funny and completely over the top. A lot of reviews seem have a problem with this movie having it's own point of view. It's those unique points of viewa that makes things cool.
I like the choices made by the director and writer. Great movie!






Completely Harley Quinn' movie.
Best actions + new way of storytelling... :)






Life without the joker gets hard when the enemy's she made while under his protection find out he's no longer in the picture.
Its not quite the quality of suicide squad but still a great showing.






It's not Deadpool. Tries too hard to imitate. Not sure if this is the style of story telling best suited for H/Q. I think if they followed the format of suicide squad it would have been a bit better pull to swallow.Also it's nice how Male and Female characters get along nicely but in ultra feminist movies they have to have a butch, femboy males, and brain dead males. Not sure if I will rewatch. I took my son and his friends to this (would not have watched otherwise)...and this was the hardest pill for all 3 of us to swallow. Too caustic. Too many themes in your face. Takes 40 minutes for you to finally get a laugh in. Will not be watching a sequel. But it is worth watching once






With the R rating I really expected this movie to be fun and violent but it just seemed a bit empty at times.. like nothing was happening and you were just waiting on things to get on.It also felt a bit cringe at certain situations and the dialogue didn't feel suitable from other characters, other than all that I thought Margot Robbie's performance was great and the action sequences were good mostly.I can't see a sequel for this happening as it's no surprise the ratings are just average and the box office is off to a rather disappointing start..






What a movie I see last time... Just wow😱
Fighting skills, movie plot, BGM skill😘😘
I love Margo's comedy.. Just feel it Deeeply😍😍






It was great to see women prove all the misogynists wrong and make a great movie. The fights scenes are realistic like they could actually happen. You've got a list actors. And it's Harley quinn why wouldn't you see this movie? It's original and some of the visuals are defintely worth the big screen view. It keeps my opinion that the DC movies have been better than the Marvel as a whole.






It's violent, funny and girly, but I loved it. It's hard to describe, but just imagine Rambo getting impregnated bij Quentin Tarantino and a unicorn. This film is the baby that comes out of that escapade.






Led by an enthusiastic performance we've come to expect from Margot Robbie, Birds of Prey manages to elevate its generic plot with well-choreographed action and entertaining characters who prove to be a welcome addition to the DC Universe.






Don't believe the INCELs, this movie has plenty of laughs, fun action scenes, cool Easter eggs and everything else you would want in a comic book movie.
Robbie, MacGregor and Winstead are all excellent as always, and the rest of the cast are great too.
Don't let the big screen Suicide Squad debacle sway you, this is much better than that. A must-see for Harley Quinn fans and anybody who can appreciate a good antihero flick.






Female superhero fantasy action from DC.Harley Quin has just split from Joker and is now working for the villain 'Black mask'. She accidentally assembles a band of female miss-fits, the cop (Renee), the singer (Black Canary), the psycho (Herself) and the Mafia princess (Huntress) to recover a missing diamond.Very little CGI as in the recent 'Joker'.
Humour and 4th wall narration as in 'Deadpool'.
Fight action as in 'John Wick'.
A bit of pop-corn high energy nonsense.






At the beginning very funny, surprising good jokes and editing, as a Guy Richie movie, but than unfortunetly from the second half turns into a random action movie. Why?






There are certain actors who have been cast excellently in comic book movie leading roles. Among those, is Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn. "Birds of Prey: And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn" offers a look at Gotham's crime-filled underworld with our totally unhinged leading lady, the aforementioned, Ms. Harley Quinn. Before this movie was released, director, Cathy Yan, stated that the film was influenced by other films including "Pulp Fiction" and "Leon: The Professional". When you watch the movie, you can obviously tell that the films did play a huge role in the story. In spite of the movie being called "Birds of Prey", the movie actually belongs to Harley Quinn. She becomes this person who has nothing left and finds herself in this chase for a kid to save her life. Like Suicide Squad, the film has a unique style and appearance almost as if Harley herself was the production designer for this movie. The soundtrack goes well with every scene where each song was meticulously placed. In case you didn't know, this movie is rated R, meaning that they were allowed to curse, show more grotesque violence and just have fun with it. This is a technique that worked well for Deadpool, another R-rated comic book film. There's even some parts of the movie that reminded me a lot of Deadpool and Deadpool 2 (You'll know what I mean if you stay through the credits). Other characters in this movie include Roman Sionis (Ewan McGregor), the film's lead villain who reminded me a lot of Dennis Hopper from 'Blue Velvet' for some reason. There's also a determined cop named Renee Montoya played by a still-wonderful Rosie Perez, a tough singer, named Dinah Lance (Jurnee Smollet-Bell), an assassin seeking vengeance named Helena Bertinelli ( Mary Elizabeth Winstead) , and a pickpocket-thief wanted by everyone named Cassandra Cain (Ella Jay Basco). Together they bring the story of the Birds of Prey to life.






Bird of preyAfter watching suicide squad yesterday I am all fought up ready for pirds of prey
I know it's more of a spin off than I direct sequel to suicide squad but as it's still the same Harley and the same film universe.Hats off to Margot Robbie as Harlequin she is fantastic and although called birds of prey is without a doubt her movie and not really a birds of prey movie
It may aswell he called Harlequin featuring the birds of prey
But by the end that really doesn't matter.
Starting with her breakup from the joker one from then on events unfold in a spectacular violent fashion.
This is the first dc extended universe movie to be rated 15 and it earns it
There's loads of f bombs and plenty of violence.
There's a part where Haley breaks a guys leg 3 times with a bat and it's glorious.
The fights were imaginative and there are plenty of them.
For me it had a Deadpool sort vibe
We start out out movie with Harley narrating her story and even jumping back and forth to explain thing or characters.
Glorious swearing and violence
Not taking itself too seriously and plenty of fourth wall nods and even a joke about lack of weapons before the final showdown.
The cast are great
After Margot Robbie My favourite being Ewan McGregor as Roman sionis aka black mask and he is twisted
He plays basically I violent child who throws a tantrum when somebody takes his things.
He hates mess , He is cold and chilling while also being sadistic,funny and another well done batman villain although not completely comic accurate.
Ewan mcgereggor really puts himself into his role.
Victor Zsasz is his sidekick who isn't too bad as his henchman he is just as sadistic and is romans implied lover.
Only thing that could of made this better is Anthony cardigans Zsasz from Gotham.
Jurnee Smollett-Bell as the black canary she is stunning with a beautiful voice and baddass to go along with it.
Rosie Perez as Renee Montoya plays a cop lifted from 80's action movie and even being referenced so.
And Mary elisebth winstead as Helena bartellin aka the huntress played a somewhat smaller role than the others but just fit right.
And finally Ella jay basco as casandra Cain the thing that brings them all together
The kid who steals the diamond from Sionis and end up being protected by Harley Quinn.I really enjoyed this movie
It's defiantly my sort of film
It was pretty much a blast from opening till the end.
It had a good story,great character bone crunching action,plenty of swearing and some laugh out loud twisted humour and it's the first dc film in this series to really let lose and make a fun movie.






To be honest "Birds of Prey and bla bla bla Harley Quinn" is not actually the proper title of the movie since the later is actually the true main character rather than the former which consists of a group of heroines, instead, it should've been called "Harley Quinn and the bla bla bla Birds of Prey". Okay Jokes aside (actually I'm quiet serious about that), I was quiet worried when (before the release) some of general reviewers in Youtube called this movie a mess or quiet a little "Meh", I mean, c'mon DC, you were already on the right track since Aquaman (2018) until last year's "Joker", now you're gonna make another mess like BvS, 2017's Justice League, and 2016's Suicide Squad? I can't take this anymore, I'm a DC fanboy, I can't take any kind of embarrassment of a movie anymore, can't you guys be creative enough to consistently make a movie that everyone likes or even loves? I mean, you're creative enough to produce tens of comicbooks monthly, with literally the same characters which every fans read but suddenly it becomes sucks when you bring it up to the silver screen??? Have you guys learn nothing??? But thankfully, oh thank god, all those worry and disappointment washed away after I decided to watch it myself. Yes not so much were with me at the studio, which is understandable since it's not "Endgame", so I decided to just focus on the movie, and guess what? it's pretty fun to watch! Harley is funny, she stole every scene she was in, the absence of Leto's Joker gave rise to her charisma and interest in the general viewers regarding her personality and kickass action that I feel was lacking in 2016's Suicide Squad (though in the story his presence is felt almost in every filth of Gotham and his very name strikes fear in the hearts of the city's biggest mobs, since the filmmaker position him to be like Ledger's Joker than the one portrayed by Joaquin Phoenix). We also get to see her other side, her lovely kind-hearted side that would make anyone easily sympathize and fall for her, I mean seriously Margot Robbie is quiet stunning (almost with the same effect when I first saw Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman on her first portrayal in BvS) on the camera and her acting skill really bring up the best out of Harley Quinn, which makes me wonder how did I not realize this on her first silver screen appearance in 2016?. Ewan McGregor's performance definitely cannot go overlooked too, I don't quietly aware if his character's counterpart from the source material has the exact same personality, but Ewan reaaly kills it on portraying an evil of a mafia boss with anger management issue which constantly is always in a state of flux thanks to his insecurities. Black Canary's appearance is a little bit different from her image in the comicbook, huntress is a little bit weird to me (almost to the point that I think she is a robot), Renee Montoya's performance is sadly I think is just average, and Cassandra Cain, in my surest opinion, is not what fans would expect or hope for to the point that many of them will fall into disappointment. The choreography for the fight scenes, especially the ones that Harley performs, is very cool and badass, though sometimes I think some of it are a little bit forced by the power of the girls' plot armor. The style of some shots and the gag sequences remind me of any movie directed by Quentin Tarantino (maybe inspired, I don't know), some elements from Harley's previous movie are also brought up here (to make an indirect connection I guess) and most of the time, I enjoy watching it from the title to the credits. Sooooo, yeah, I think it's another win for DC, though not commercially, but at least critics like it more than 2016's Suicide Squad and saw this as an improvement and a good sign that DC is finally find it's own way, it's own style of bringing up its beloved characters without as so much as just blatantly copying Marvel's formula. I think DC should prioritize more on the critical acclaim rather than the commercial one, even though the latter is also very important, because in any company or corporation, the quality of the products must always be put first. From there, comes the trust and faith of the customers (in this case, the fans and the general viewers). From there, commercial success automatically follows.






Chaotic and fun. Robbie once again shows that she's more than just a pretty face. She's at the top of her game with no end in sight.This movie is also the perfect response to those insecure fanboys who trash female centered movies without seeing them.When this kills at the box office, it will make it easier when the next such film comes out.






I went in expecting a really, really badly made film with god awful action sequences. The trailers did not do this movie any justice. It was a decent film, it's not bad at all.
I recommend people to go watch it for sure.
IN MY OPINION, it's another case of "The Witcher" where it was marketed as woke man bashing female power movie. It's average-good movie. If you try to go in and look for the woke stuff, you will notice them but at the same time, you'll also realize that the vast majority of the males in the movie are criminals.
Each female member had a motive for doing what they had to do, which is a good thing.






Margot Robbie killed it as Harley Quinn. This movie is so much better than Suicide Squad, for sure!
Lots of fun. I love the action though it is too telegraph... a bit too neat, but I love the way they do it. Very exciting and fun and colourful.Would love to see more Ewan Mcgregor too. The guy was delightfully psycho.There are some choppy bit like repetition on some stuffs but I can overlook that because the characters are delightful and interesting. Huntress definitely stand out from the other girls. Next to that is Black Canary and the lil kid. The Policewoman was kinda boring (sorry to say).Overall it is a good watch. The music choice was also good. Some classic/ jazz songs, some that I don't know but suits the movie. Would rewatch it when it comes out in dvd for sure.






LIKES:Funny Writing
Good Use Of All Characters
Expansion Of Characters
The Action At The End
Feels Very Much Like A Comic Book Presentation
Margot Robbie's Portrayal of Harley past the first act
DISLIKES:
Boring At Times
The Presentation At Times
The Cursing At Times
The Action Is Okay In The Middle Of the Movie
Slow Motion Over Use
The Politics Again
The Main Villain Is Lame... againThe VERDICT:You may have heard this is the best DC movie in the longest time, and others not so much. This reviewer thinks that the film is the middle of the pack, beating my expectations on many things, but still looking for some tightening up to help get the same levels that Wonder Woman and Shazam held for me. It's got the edge, the attitude, the fun and the use of characters and character development was a major selling point for me. I found this to be a fun comic book movie though, with a new aged flare and promise for some more fun films starring Ms. Robbie. However, I'd like the politics to be toned back a bit, put some more though into the villains like they did the protagonists, and make the action have the dynamic energy that I know they can do and not rely so much on the slow-motion versions that DC loves. Still, this movie I think is worth a trip to the theaters and would encourage you to get out there and see it if you have time.My scores are:Action/Adventure/Crime: 7.5
Movie Overall: 6.5






So this movie is probably 85% story and 15% action, because this is an introduction to new characters and back story. But it's great, perfect amount of Harleys twisted humor, witty commentary, and a lot of her just being kickass. Only bad part about this movie in my opinion were the other characters kind of had lame costume design but whatever no biggie. It was very entertaining and oh did I mention violent? Fantastic choreography also. I know I'm all over the place, I'm not good at giving reviews, but don't be fooled, this movie is great.






Okay, so, first things first. As a fan of huntress, I really wish there was more of her in the movie. She is an interesting character, the actress was good and she even had some pretty fun moments, but too little screen time.
The rest of the movie is a fun ride, but fails to be anything other than that.
The feminist theme is very clear in the entire run, which was something I liked. All of the villains are men and they are all mad, no exceptions, and the men are mad, but you get where they were going with that. The problem is that they all become one dimensional. Black Mask, the big bad, is just a violent misogynistic creep, and that's it.
Aside from that, the old trope of one foe attacking at a time instead of banding together and attacking at once makes some of the fight scenes kind of boring, predictable and silly.
I wanted to love this movie, but ended up just emjoying it mildly.






Horrible concept, horrible idea to make a movie based on a character that is annoying as hell and no one cares about. This version of Harley is enough to make me not care to sit through the whole movie. DC making another horrible idea to go through with making this movie. Won't even break even money wise unless they go right to DVD.
I absolutely loved it! Very much like a female-led Deadpool vibe. Fantastic!
I loved it, personally. It wasn't the classic "Comic Book Movie" so much as a Comic Book AS a movie and it did it with STYLE!

Go see it!
It was a Little predictable, but still entertaining
It was a fun, action packed movie that kept me entertained throughout. The actresses kicked butt in this stand alone.
It’s a good movie a must watch wish there was more criminal violence from Harley.
I honestly loved this movie.  It was so entertaining and I enjoyed the heck out of it!
It was a BADASS MOVIE just like every other movie DC makes. Not just focusing on one character but making new ones on the way. I'm really joping Birds of Prey get their own film!! 🥰
Uninspired, constant hand to hand combat, coupled with Margot Robbies fake NY accent wears thin after a 1/2 hour (especially when theres no MR nude scenes!) It wasnt horrible but it WAS utterly forgettable.
Great girl-power movie that retains the adorable character of Harley Quinn (played by Margot Robbie) established in Suicide Squat.  And there is a fantastic sound track as well.

If you like DC,  you would love it!
Is action all the way, her twisted crazy self will keep you entertained and laughing the whole 2 hrs.
No kids...
I loved it. I am a DC Fan at heart and I had a blast. It’s a refreshing movie, different than the usual, but unique in its own way. Ready for Wonder Woman and The Batman to be next.
Great action, decent story, interesting cinematography.
Boring movie I would like to have my money back on this one
Worst movie ever, dont wast your money or time.
Horrible, 2nd worst movie I’ve ever seen.
well this was my third time watching it... so it must have been good
Great to keep Margot Robbie
Action was great. Waiting for Part 2
Kick ass movie. A bit campy...in the BEST way!!
I loved this movie! While its technically a superhero movie it really spoke to the experiences so many women deal with. I think its the first time Ive seen a movie that spoke to me that deeply yet was still able to be fun and entertaining. The soundtrack was amazing as well and suited the film perfectly. Ill probably go see Birds of Prey again while its still in theaters.
Movie was all over the place didn't like it at all
I really wanted to like this. I love Margot.... but even she couldn’t save this movie...
Amazing movie..  kept you interested the whole movie
Fun, Funny, and rated R
So much fun! Just an all around great action movie.
Yawn, it has a few moments but what a waste of a good budget & good characters.
I was in my seat smiling through out the movie. I was laughing because the movie is really funny. Black Mask is threatening and funny. Huntress steals the show when she enters the scene (sometime literally and I love it). It may focus so much on Harley and it may take time away from the Birds of Prey but I still feel that Birds have their time in the spot light.  It was like I was watching Dead pool one for the first time.
Comedic, had more blood, guts and "F Bombs" than Suicide Squad which was a downer.
Good movie, Harley was a little too serious vs her original character in the comics...she's silly and fun! The original creators should've written the movie script due to their intimate knowledge of her character and background. Overall, it was a good movie, strong character lines and action. Just needed a few tweeks here n there in my opinion.
Better than average for DC these days, but still felt like two movies were crammed together.
This movie was unexpectedly awesome from start to finish. I love that they made this almost like a female version of dead pool, with great adult humor,gruesome deaths and tons and tons of action scenes. Hopefully a part 2 will come out and hold the hype this movie has now created.
Loved everything about this movie! The actors, fashion, music, etc.!
I really enjoyed the movie.
Another miss for the DC world...Yes the action scenes were great, but the characters, both good guys (or gals) and bad, were bland and boring.
I love how it was in modern day time.
loved the actors and the action scenes!!
It was ok. Not funny, no really interesting cast members. The villain wasn’t interesting. Just basically Quinn saying things and getting into fights. Suicide squad was far better. She seemed to enjoy her role more in Suicide Squad too. 
It was very well made
WB made yet another dc disconnected movie
Women empowerment! It was so bad ass. I wish it couldve been longer
I wasnt a fan of the movie at all
Very entertaining! Love Harley Quinn! Rosie Perez was great !
Funnest ride I've had watching a movie in a long time. I loved it. Going to see it again for sure.
Margo Robbie was a hoot. The rest was just so so
Great movie with women empowerment
Funny and action packed without being too much. Loved it!
Honestly I think it was exceptional. Everyone needs to see Ewan McGregor as Black mask. He is extraordinary!!!
This was a fun movie to watch, wished the Joker made a appearance.
It was kind of all over the place, never really went anywhere till 3/4 of the movie.
I loved this movie and would go back to see it.  The special effects/fighting scenes were excellently choreographed and following the plot was easy to follow.
Realmente queria que me gustara esta pelicula pero simplemente no pude, es demasiado mala. Es entretenida, eso si, me gusta mucho a margot como harly y el patron de colores y los disfraces estan bonitos pero hasta ahi, todo lo demas es muy muy malo. Fui a verlo sola y eramos literalmente 5 personas en la sala. Una decepcion.
Tons of fun, Margot was awesome!
Fire, the only down sides are the action sequences and the very end.
One of my favorite DC films, the characters are amazing and it's a damn good comic book movie.
Harley is always a blast
Just saw Birds of Prey yada-yada Harley Quinn. 

Guys...  

It. Was. SOOOO. GOOD! Like, the most fun Ive had at a movie in a loooong time. Like, THIS is what Deadpool was trying to be but got lost up its own backside (maybe Marvel Studios will do the Merc with the Mouth better?) 

So much fun. 

How has Mary Elizabeth Winstead not already been cast as a major franchise superhero?! MCU, you missed out.
Very exciting and entertaining. Lived it
This movie was a unique original story that broke the mold of a typical DCU / MCU cinematic offering.  The story telling was great and so were the action sequences.  I would say that this is the 2 film that DC has put out today.
Started off strong but fizzled towards the end. Not a ton of Birds of Prey... should have just been called Harley Quinn. Between 2 1/2 and 3 stars.
loved the movie but some fight scenes were a little telegraphed especially when slowed the movie
I liked the portrayal of strong women characters.
In a world of action movies, Birds of Prey is a much needed jolt of adrenaline. Margot Robbie was born to play Harley Quinn as she does so with such ease that you forget the actor behind the mask. A sequence about a perfect sandwich is enough to make the film uniquely fun and the performances by a wonderful cast add weight to a light script. The action sequences are really fucking cool too. Go see this movie, it does not disappoint.
Must see. Action packed. Will see again.
Some caracteres were so Overreacted
Disappointed in this movie!
While people that are really strict about comic accuracy may dislike BoP, I thought it was an entertaining way to spend an afternoon. Great action scenes with a hefty order of humor and sarcasm. Also, that soundtrack is awesome
Harley Quinn is in her full glory here! But Black Mask was not a worthy adversary! They didn't portray Black Canary, Huntress, & the cop (Rosie Perez) parts too good either. But who cares when Harley's kicking all the ass!!!
Ehhh, it wasnt terrible... at least it was better than Suicide Squad. And thankfully Leto wasnt in it to RUIN the Joker. Margot did Amazing! Ewan was Great! Everyone else was Good too... but it was still missing something. I cant say exactly what it is... but something is definitely missing. Id recommend it
It was a fun movie! Full of action! Margot is a beast as Harley! Rosie is fantastic as always. It wasnt the BoP I was used to reading, and thats fine for me. It was a fresh take. Id like to see where they go with it.
Great sound track and good action
Absolutely wonderful!!! One of the greatest comic movie made!
Terrible. I was waiting for the movie to end
Absolutely perfect! It's the Deadpool of DC Comics.
It's really bad screen-writing, bad pacing, canned action, it's basically charlies angels.
Look. This film is full of color, combat and chaos. It's the soundtrack to my 2020.
Loved it. The action was spot on, characters were live and over the top.
Nothing to dislike about! Two thumbs up great movie
Loved it it was in my top 3 movies of the DCEU
Worst movie Ive ever seen in my life.
Plot was weak, character development was missing for all but Harley.  Just another Harley Quinn movie.  Just ok.
Movie was terrible. Although it wasn't as bad as Suicide Squad, it was very, very close.
Needs a better duration time
This movie is hilarious! I can't wait to go see it again!
Loved it definitely would go see it again
Harley Quinn was amazing! Everything I expected and more. Loved seeing the good guys work with her as well and seeing her have some emotion!
Margo Robbie controlled the screen. But outside of Harley quinn being a female Deadpool, the movie was meh.
Great movie I suggest seeing it would 100% see it again 
A female ensemble that is fun and action-packed like a glittery Deadpool with the fight scenes like John wick.
Badass women, kicking butt. My only wish is that the group of women joined up with each other sooner in the movie. The dynamic between them was amazing and they were great as a fighting team all together! Loved it
just boring. wast of time. 
Action, humor, and purpose. This movie is definitely a must see.
Excellent movie!! So much fun from beginning to end! The entire cast was fantastic! Tons of great action and incredible fight scenes! Loved every minute of it!!
I loved it so much that I saw it twice in one day!
the movie is boring and the acting  is not good and there was no way this is a good dc movie.
disappointed. no real plot.
Good different movie but really good unable to rate but 5 stars is it
Awesome.. girl power
Loved the fight scenes and soundtrack was great. It's a fun and entertaining ride of Harley craziness.
Fun movie , hell of witty.. Love me Harley Quinn...And the I shaved my balls for this was “CLASSIC”
colorful. fast paced. felt like a comic book. great cinematography. hilarious villain
Great movie. Margot Robbie did an excellent job. Great action scenes intermixed with humor.
It is a good movie and I enjoy it!
A must watch for fans of Harley
Totally cool movie, I need a lady like this in my life!
Seriously I love the characters and the plot. Honestly don’t over look this amazing movie.
Fun and silly. A vulgar romp that will work for anyone who wants a rollicking good time.
how did this movie get any good ratings, everybody should be fired. I can't believe Margot Robbie did this movie. got to be the worst movie of the year and it's only February
Birds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn) is a very artistic film filled with some really gorgeous shots. There are some great moments of both comedy and action. There is a lot of girl power in this move and it was awesome. I can see how people will no doubt enjoy this movie. I'm just not sure if I enjoyed it.
I wanted more out of the movie.  Much like suicide squad so much was crammed into such a short time and there was no real connection to anything.  I love Margo Robbies Harley Quinn but this movie just missed the mark for me.  I am sure I will still own it as I have all the other marvel/dc movies but it definitely wasnt the best dc movie I heard it was.
Good movie, with good action..the representation of some of the characters were a little off but all in all..I liked it
I thought Margot Robbie was really good!!
It was mediocre. Many of the jokes just did not land. The action scenes were solid and the only reason this doesn't warrant a 2 star review. Also, while it seems many liked Ewan Mcgregor's villian, I was not in that camp.
Exceed my expectations. Lots of fun and both Margot Robbie and ewan mcgregor are awesome. I hope DC continues to put out movies like this and Joker
The movie title is deceiving, you get Harley Quinn featuring a knockoff version of Birds of Prey, you'll find generic fight sequences and it feels like a movie consists of different clips that were poorly glued during the edition. I'm not quite sure what were they trying to accomplish but for me having a female lead doesn't justify a fresh rating. At the end of the day, you can't deceive the audience and this movie got the opening box office that it deserved, worth of mouth won't help it.
Loved the gore and violence!
Great story, a little silly at times, but that's why Harley Quinn character is awesome.
A couple of good fight scenes but mostly poor dialogue and plot line. I was mostly waiting for it to end.
Awesome acting and really cool fight scenes! 
We enjoyed it. I don't know if I would take kids but its fun.
Good character development of Harley.  Nice display of female power.  A little choppy at times.
I LOVED this movie. Im a longtime fan of the Birds of Prey comics and Black Canary is one of my all time favorite characters. Jurnee Smollet-Bell perfectly embodied everything I  love about Dinah, and Margot Robbie was chaotically charming as Harley. The fight sequences were expertly choreographed and were an absolute blast to watch. This movie was bright and colorful and action-packed and vulgar and hilarious and, most importantly, FUN.
Total chick flick, great action sequence.
DC definitely feels like they know how to do female characters without throw in the fact that they are a woman in your face. Unfortunately few of the characters for disappointing compared to the comic book counterparts. They also seem like they were trying to be more like Deadpool in a lot of ways.
this film was AWESOME.  best
Really enjoyable fighting. The fight scenes felt very fresh in a genre full of them. Ewan and Margot were excellent in their roles.
One word....... Bad!!
It’s a female driven fun ride about redemption and revenge. I can’t wait to see it again.
It was okay almost fell asleep 3 times. Thats saying something for a short movie. I will say another 20/30 minutes of previews and ads dont help though. No plot whatsoever and reliving the same scenes I didnt care for. Wife liked it so thats all that matters.  out of
Daughter loved it! We enjoyed it as well!
Shades of Quentin Tarantino in a DC flick👍🏾
It was funny. Full of action and nice, heartwarming moments. It was great over all. Felt a little empowered after watching it.
Excellent movie. Margo was has gone above and beyond her character. The rest of the crew was phenomenal.  Highly recommended for DC fans.
I enjoyed it but I love DC and Marvel so I may be biased.
as always Margo kicked BUTT
Way better than suicide squad! Sucks that they didn’t market it very well... theater was pretty empty. But the movie its self did Haley Quinn justice! Was fun to watch, I’d go again.
A funny, insane, action-packed BIG screen experience! You will have an awesome time!
It was a lot of fun.
It's too bad nobody is seeing this movie. It pulls a lot of stuff in from the Amanda Conner Harley books and has the best choreographed and shot fight scenes in a DCU movie imo. Just plain fun!
Let me first start off by saying I am a HUGE Harley Quinn fan. I have loved this character ever since her first appearance in the Batman animated series, prompting her first comic book appearance in Mad Love. I walked into this movie with ZERO expectations as I wanted to keep an own mind. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. While the movie resembles the new Harley Quinn 52 to rather than birds-of-prey, it has a great storyline. Margot Robbie does a great job of caputuring her version of Harley Quinn which as a die hard fan, I can't hate on. The movie is visually ststunning, bring in both the dark and comic book feel you want to this type of movie. Give it a chance, I don't think you will be disappointed.
It was a good time!!
It was boring and poorly put together. The movie jumped from time to time without warning. I hated this movie and wanted hard earned money for nothing
Girl Power in a violent way
other than that, a great movie
Almost walked out several times.  The review on commonsense media made it sound like Suicide Squad but I can't agree.  DC had a character that essentially stole the show in Suicide Squad an they basically blew it, yet again.
Amazing movie. Loved Canary and Quinn. I wish they could have made Cassandra Cain but more developed character. Thoroughly enjoyed.
this movie was very funny with lots of great action and the only thing I wanted was for it to be longer
A really bad movie and not at all faithful to the characters and the comics,
a real insult to longtime fans of the characters
An unreliable narrator is one thing, but the story still needs some sort of substance and believability.
The movie was great, a dark comedy with awesome action. Harley Quinn at her best.
Amazing action! Great story and acting. Really liked it
Not stop entertainment
I loved the fighting sequences and I thought the movie was funny.
Fantastic movie, Barry well executed.
The movie was okay.  Had some good parts to it, but never felt like it was a story that needed to be told.  You know, kind of like a lot of the DCU movies.
Wicked, and kickass! In the same vein as Deadpool! Women rule in this!!
Pretty boring. A movie with Harley Quinn shouldn't be boring.
It’s was awesome! It was a really fun ride! Harley Quinn is crazy! I really enjoyed it.
Do not go and see. Horribly acted and directed. I like DC comic movies and I don’t like this one
Margot Robbie proved again her versatility, being charged with the foremost role of this movie. The story is oddly refreshing and even if it is predictable and could be shortened aiming to doesn't lose its focus. It has some funny jokes that won't make you grin but that will amuse you.
I wasn't too interested at first, but boy, I ended up really liking this movie! It's pretty funny, not as much as Deadpool, but it's very entertaining. And I read that the Director of John Wick helped with the action and you can tell! I loved the action scene's and I'm planning on watching it again
Terrible acting and plot. I was looking forward to this movie but was so disappointed that I almost walked out of the movie theater.
This movie was a lot of fun to watch. Margot Robbie delivers
I love this film SO much!!  I can't WAIT to see it again next weekend!
The humor, gore, character development, and sheer girl power made this movie one of my favorites!
A really stupendously fun movie. No stupid “fate of the world” antics with zero weight. Just a good story about a bad woman who just wants to get out alive. 
Very disappointed.  Very cartoonish.
Awesome movie. I loved the fight scenes and special effects.
Pretty consistent action, and a good cast make this for a must see. Wasn't boring or bland, and the plot was well thought out, and the rewind bits were nice.
When this film was first announced, I’ll admit I had little to no desire to see it (even though I did enjoy Harley I’m Suicide Squad). Then the trailers started releasing and it further confirmed my disinterest. So why did I end up seeing it? Word of mouth. My friends and the general public seemed very pleased with it. Was the plot award winning? No, not by any means. Was there some rough acting (specifically from Cassandra Cain’s character)? Yes. But this movie surprised the hell out of me. The action scenes were some of the most creative and entertaining I’ve seen out of a comic film to date. There’s specifically a scene where Harley uses her bat and does something with it that has me look around like “Did you see THAT?!” Margot Robbie is incredible as Harley Quinn. She kept the movie plenty entertaining and had some really great moments. The other Birds of Prey didn’t have as much screen time as I’d have liked, but they leave the door open for a lot of character development with them (specifically Black Canary). Don’t miss out of a good time at the theater with this one!
It's was a crazy story from start to finish, but it had plenty of personality since it was told from Harley Quinn POV, but I have to admit it was a hell of a ride even though some parts dragged on.
It's everything you want in a movie about Harley Quinn. Top-notch jokes, action, characterization, and DC lore that keeps you entertained from the very beginning.
I get it. It has its weird moments. But if you take it for what it is - fun - you will enjoy this movie. The audience laughed and cheered and it was FUN!!
lots of action and really good effect.  a little short on story...ok I get it, it's an introduction to the characters..but the back and forth is tough to stay with.  I'm hoping the sequel is a more focused plot.  still it's a really fun movie and worth a view at the theater
As a movie, 7-7.5 out of 10, but as a comic book movie, a lot of the characters had different origins than the comics that distracted myself from the movie, but where was Batman?
Not what I expected ...
It was a fun movie. I though Margot Robbie and Ewan McGregor really committed to the roles. Jurnee Smollett Bell did a fabulous job with what little screen time she got. It was clear the movie was tryna go the Deadpool route but it wasn't as funny and didn't have as good action scenes. though I did like the police station sequence.
Don’t let the bad marketing fool you! This was an incredibly fun, irreverent comic book romp. I’m glad I gave it a chance. 
Very entertaining and action packed
Harley and Black Mask were pretty good and the action was decent, but the rest of the movie just didn't do justice to the Birds of Prey. I would have much preferred if they had kept this as just a fun Harley movie in the style of Deadpool (e.g. which didn't try to also cram in origins for the secondary characters).  They should have had other movies to build up Huntress, Black Canary, and others as iconic characters before a team-up.  Now they may have killed any hope for those kick-azz characters to fly on their own.
Movies was ok wish they had more crazy part like joker pop out of no where
Wonderful redemption story for Harley. Great imagery, great action scenes, good dialogue, and a great soundtrack.
I liked it, but I am still processing it. We enjoyed it and will see it again.
Fun a lot of action 👍
Super fun!! I have seen this twice now and have loved each viewing. It def belongs with Wonder Woman as best of the DCEU films. Margot’s gamble paid off big time and I’m so glad she was able to get this movie made after the hell she went through on Suicide Squad.
I love it, I did hear it did terrible over the weekend. Kind suck as will, did not make the money like it should of. But I love it was funny and great acting from the actors and wonderful characters as will. The Director did a good job and costumes for great.
Thats being nice. I just feel it couldve been a lot better .i like the actors but theyre not ready to carry the torch alone.
It kills me that this movie didn't do well in the box offices because it is absolutely fantastic. Funny and awesome and all around incredible.
Great story line,funny.
Great cinematography... story was so so... but fun to watch!
It’s a good movie, I thought it flowed better than Suicide Squad. The comic book nerd in me prevents this from getting a higher rating (I don’t want to say why in risk of a spoiler).
I'm glad DC decided to open up and do more of their characters of bad ones.
great movie had a fun time one of the best dc movies harley quinn is the deadpool of dc.
Margot Robbie makes the movie.
Tank Girl goes postal in this ladies night kick-ass comic.
Very entertaining! Love the girl crew!
Average story, average acting, good choreographed fight scenes.  Just an average movie. Too many jump backs in time to tell a story.
Awesome movie for the empowerment of women despite some uncomfortable scenes. Excellent fight scenes injected with humor. Margo is the perfect Harley Quinn.
One of the worst movies that I have ever seen.
Good movie the family enjoyed hareen quinn was great
It wasn't horrible but it wasn't the bomb either. It got boring in the middle of the movie I dozed off for a bit, then it picked up towards the end. On a high note the acting was good no complaints there. There was one dumb scene when Canary unleashed her power dropping all of the men and Harley was able to skate through it unharmed, I rolled my eyes on that one.

Where I have a problem with the movie is the title and The Birds of Prey's costumes. The tile is basically a fraud this is about Harley the other characters were basically filler, they should have left Birds of Prey out of the title.  My second issue is none of the Birds customs resembled what they wear in the book. They would have been better off creating some new characters to compliment Harley.

It's a decent popcorn ( curly fries for me) flick if you just want to watch something on the fun side.
So much fun! Loved it.
The movie was hilarious and had great fight scenes any DC fan will love it
Great movie ! It kept u interested not a boring moment thru the whole movie
Horrendous and infinitely unwatchable.  A complete mess.
I love the girl power showing all aspects and ages working together in the end
A must see. One of the best DC movies of the past decade
A really funny movie with good action scenes.
DC films I think are performing better with R ratings than PG13. They can cover DC comics dark sides and bring out more character development.
Loved Harley, the story, her emancipation, and the SANDWICH!!! I just made them for dinner!!!!
It was loud, fun, and unapologetically awesome.
it was a ton of fun to watch.  pretty funny but had an OK story line.  one of the better DC movies for sure.
The ONLY thing I disliked (very much) was the language. Its not that I care about language at all but this was highly overdone. The movie would have been perfect if the bad language was cut by about 40%. It just was way overdone. It just wasnt necessary. But, all else was sheer perfection!
It was a little slow to get moving, but once it does it is a ton of fun. Fantastic fight scenes and great chemistry. Plus Ewan McGregor speaks with an American accent and its the weirdest thing ever and I loved it. Go see it so I can have a sequel to watch!!!
I thought it was a fun and hysterical movie
Super fun movie.  My girlfriend and I absolutely loved it.  One of the best DC movies in the last couple of years.
The movie was ok, but not worth spending your money on.
Such an amazing second appearance of Harley,so excited to see more of the birds of prey
I really liked this movie. It is funny and has great acting.
That Harley  Quinn is a funny lune.
Fun for the whole family! Take the kids!
It was good.  I saw it as a women empowerment movie.  I saw the animation version and this was along the same story line.
Very disappointing! Was expecting so much more after Suicide Squad, but Harley Quinn and the all female cast did not deliver

Colorful, clever, creative action sequences, and so much less male gaze than we were used to in Suicide Squad. All around fantastic.
Thought movienwas great.harley and black mask did not disappoint.wish title wasnt birds of prey because they were utilized and for obvious reasons harley was main character.But another great dc movie to continue there string of good movies.
Absolute blast from beginning to end. 
Excellent movie plenty if action and miner drama. I would recommend it for the whole family.
It wasnt bad but it wasnt great.  Moderately entertaining so thats cool.
Fun, action packed entertainment.
I was expecting much more comedy, but even when they were trying hard, it just wasn’t. Very violent and they should replace some fight scenes with scenes that flesh out the characters. Just a flash back biography does not cut it. 
Great cast. Fun story
I had a really fun time with Birds of Prey! It’s too bad it’s not doing as well at the box office, but I chalk that up to its connection with the horrendous Suicide Squad and weaker marketing. I thought it was funny and enjoyable, with Margot Robbie (Harley Quinn) and Evan McGregor (Black Mask) killing it. This is the movie Suicide Squad wanted to be.
One of the best movies of the last few years, with good characters, good action sequences, good character development, and a good soundtrack. Overall very good movie. Although, a tit bit is that the character development was dragged out slightly, but it was needed as there was like 20 different characters to introduce so it just ok. Little dragged out but nothing too unbearable.

Not as good as I had hoped
With great performances all around, and some genuinely funny screen writing, Birds of Prey is an entertaining comic book film like no other. Not to mention it has an awesome soundtrack.
Incredible action and comedy that blend together seamlessly, likable characters, brilliant performances, and amazing editing (you'll know what I mean when you watch) Margot Robbie, Euan MacGregor and all knock it out of the park. Please don't let the trailers turn you off, this film really earned the love
Really good comic book movie, very enjoyable and tons of fun.
Basically, it was variations of fight scenes over and over and over. Fail.
The movie was amazing and so much fun!!! If you want a fun night at the movies go see it. The action was awesome, music was on point and the cast was amazing. Margot Robbie and Ewan McGregor steal the show!!!
This movie is one of the best in the DCEU. Each of the characters have so much potential in the DCEU and the violence and craziness just made the movie a whole lot better
Fast paced and fun, Birds of Prey makes up for all the things Suicide Squad lacked. Harley breaks the third wall and pulls no punches, and leads the other girls - Black Canary, Huntress & Renee Montoya on a wild ride all to protect Cassandra Kane, a foster kid and petty thief. This movie has fantabulous action and humor! Must see!
ITS AWESOME
HARLEY IS PEEFECT
One of the better DC films
I really enjoyed it, Was very entertaining, Harley was scattered just like she in the comic books
alot of bad words , overall liked the movie
Literally such a fun movie, had a blast watching it!
it was a fun, action packed, ride with appealing women
It's pretty generic, somewhat corny and the humour was mostly a miss. It's better than suicide squad, but not much.
screw what the critics say, this was awesome!
The good news and bad for DC Films is that one, Birds of Prey/Harley Quinn has a high ranking among both film reviewers and AND fans , but two, it is a significant financial disappointment at the box office. Sometimes it seems the DC film division cannot catch a break. Oh well...whatever...as the kids like to say...whatever...Still, I can't imagine it would such severe blow as as the collective pinched nerve called the internet make it sound, as Birds of Prey's price tag was a little over 84 million dollars  and that it grossed around 81 million bucks globally in its opening weekend.  Theoretically, the project has nearly made its money back in its first four days of release, not a horrible thing, and with about another four-five weeks remaining in theaters, I suspect the film will have made back all its expenses, including promotional costs, and show a profit, perhaps a tidy one.  However the bottom turns out, be informed that this a good comic book movie which ought to appeal to the crowds who found Dead Pool and John Wick movies a hoot. There is not a wasted frame here, the fight sequences and superbly and breezily staged, and the trapezoidal editing sequence keeps this a disorienting but ultimately reward thrill ride.
So freaking great, punchy and colorful! Birds of Prey is way better than I expected. It makes me love the characters even more than I already did as a comics addict. I would love to see a sequel.
It had great potential, an the raw tools to make for a good story, but was just too draggy and then when they got to the final fight, it was over too fast.  Nice try for a feminist hero for the DC world.
I enjoyed it for what it was
a good well made film
The cringe is real, you mean in a movie for female power there are absolutely no women working in a desk office in the PD besides the detective. Where is the representation?
Hilarious, Intriguing, and Amazing
If you’re a DC Universe and especially a Harley Quinn fan (I go back to 1992 with her) then you must see it. Margot Robbie is perfection and it’s a really fun film — nothing dark like the Joker movie but it’s a blast seeing women get to kick ass and carry a movie.
Loved the action, choreography was  fantastic, all actors excelled.  While the dialog wasn't as cringe-inducing as Suicide Squad, I'm still amazed at how it's so obvious that they don't spend their resources on better screenwriters.
Loved it! Amazing action while still following a great storyline!
I thought that this movie offered a fresh perspective to how the cinema industry has been handling much of the comic-universe films have netted out over the last several years. Here, we have a story that focuses exclusively on the initial demise and redemption arc of the villain, whose character ultimately grows into something of a positive vigilante with villain quirks. It almost had a modern day Robin Hood approach in the sense of how Harley Quinn + team ended up banding together for the greater good of defeating a larger evil at hand, even if through associated ties. Would recommend and planning on seeing a second time.
Corney and a lot of fun. I laughed and laughed. Thank god they got rid of Jared Ketos joker! The plot was predictable is the only downside. I hope they make another
Impressed by the movies ability to stay true to a lot of the comics literary content while bringing something fresh and new. Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) stoke the show! Wow
It felt like more of a story about Harley Quinn than the Birds Of Prey but it was still a fun movie.
It was a good movie!  Margot was great as Harley!
I thought it was a fun movie to watch
Fun fantastic romp with familiar characters, Harley quinn stepping into her own shoes, with a young batgirl possibly harley quinn and cassandra cane vs batman and robin
The movie isn't bad but I did feel it was lacking something. Tons of action, great music and overall fun.
the director sucked! the movies has so much potential! I'm so mad !
A fun, deranged ride.
I love how corky and female empowering it was. Super colorful and action packed. Id watch it again
Badass Bitches Kicking Ass! I had some serious reservations about this movie, especially after the debacle that was Suicide Squad. But  holy guacamole I LOVED IT!! Female friendship, mixed with some maternal instinct, lots of ass kicking. GO SEE IT NOW!!! Go with your girl gang or alone, drag your boyfriend if need be but go.
No tiene razón de ser, no tienen historia los personajes solo Harley
The movie should've been called "Harley Quinn and the Birds of Prey" because instead of featuring an ensemble cast we get Margot Robbie commanding most of the screen time and she is at the center of the story. The movie unfortunately doesn't utilize its R rating very well and should've just been rated PG-13 especially when you take a look at the box office. The movie is very well directed with a colorful visual style and cinematography that captures the action sequences in full without any rapid fire editing. The fight choreography is amazing and makes the action sequences very entertaining and is easily the best part of the movie. Margot Robbie is once again exceptional as Harley Quinn and the rest of the cast does their best with what they got which unfortunately is not much. This movie's biggest flaw is its screenplay. This movie is too much plot and not enough characterization. Harley Quinn is the only interesting character because none of the other characters get developed in a proper way. Some of the other members of the Birds of Prey feel tacked on and are barely in the movie. The movie relies way too heavily on narration and the plot is very disjointed and constantly goes back and forth in time which made the narrative flow a little confusing. There are also a lot of major story elements in this movie that straight up makes no sense. Black Mask is also a one dimensional villain that is not interesting or compelling in any real way. He never does anything himself, he makes his henchmen do everything for him which didn't make him feel like an actual threat. I was satisfied with the movie thanks to its well directed action sequences, Margot Robbie's performance, and the fact that it is better than Suicide Squad (which I think is a 3/10 movie). However, I was disappointed with it's lackluster story and mediocre side characters/villain. 6/10
somebody is trying way too hard. i should be asking WB for a refund.
Don't waste your time or money on this dumpster fire of a move.
Much better than Suicide Squad but still pretty cheesy.
Was pretty good. Enough action to keep you interested.
fun
no kids
left with a smile, due to entertainment value
With writing slightly better than Halle Berry's Catwoman and cinematography along the lines of Batman Forever, small wonder this is a fan Flop that, even if Margot Robbie bothered to try to act, could not sustain the hype past the films intro.  The one saving grace of the film is the Huntress, portrayed very well and with the best plotline for an entire five minutes.
Should probably just have been called THE FANTABULOUS EMANCIPATION OF ONE HARLEY QUINN, but other wise it was a entertaining movie with lots of action that really brought life to these comic book characters. And it was also a nice introduction for the Birds of Prey.
This movie is honestly so good! I went into this movie with the lowest expectations and I left want to drag everyone and their cousin to the movie theater and make them see it. All the women were phenomenal. I wish there was more Mary Elizabeth Winstead... but I can be too needy. Go see it. Margot killed it.
Violent, incoherent, disgusting.
Totally disjointed. Would have walked out if I wasnt with my son. Turns out he hated it too.
This movie is just plain fun! Don't listen to the naysayers harping about the awoke feminism bullcrap. It's just not there. That said, there was nothing good or promising about the Birds of Prey. Fortunately, this is 90% about Harley, and Margo Robbie and the writers pulled it off perfectly! She's Harley embracing all her criminal insanity to the fullest! I mean she falls in love with a sandwich, then goes after the cop who "murdered her sandwich!" Ha - great stuff! Every fight scene she's in borders on a cheesy martial arts movie, (I mean that in a good way!) And some of these fight scenes are the best I've seen!
Tried to make a girl version of Deadpool - failed miserably.
it was awesome I loved it ❤️💞
Loved this movie....funny, great acting (especially Margot Robbie), fun to watch, and good special effects!
I enjoyed this movie ...outstanding Especially Jurnee Smoollett and her Kung fu ..ninja Kick-but performance .
A lot of fun. Tons of style and some brilliant performances. Recommed
It was an okay movie little confusing cause the movie goes back and forth so its hard to keep up with what is going on
This is the Harley Quinn movie we should of had years ago! Great job Cathy Yan and Margot Robbie!
I loved it! It was so colorful and hilarious. From Bruce to the egg sandwich, the story is a wild rollercoaster. It's amazing!
While I am wasn't sure DC could pull this one through, but this is one of the most fun movies I've ever watched by far!
So fun I wish it didn't have to end!!! The acting was so good it gutted me. It was hilarious, exciting, intense, dark, gross and awesome... Just might've moved to the top of my list. The cast was incredible, the action was deliciously brutal and violent, the sets and wardrobe were divine... I can't wait to see it again in IMAX / Dolby!
Loved it.  Everyone was perfect in it.  I didn't like huntress till the end but the movie was great.  My wife loved it to.  Go see it.
After the disaster of Suicide Squad, I wasn't planning on seeing this movie but am glad I did! Hilarious, full of comic book references that delighted, and kickass action and visuals. I was pleasantly surprised!
Total fun movie start to finish.
La pelicula no es buena aunque tampoco es lo peor que se ha hecho en una pelicula basada en comics. Al principio es lenta y molesta, ya en los últimos minutos es donde remonta, eso si, la edición es rara, las escenas de acción no son una maravilla pero están bien pero por la edición pareciera que solo están por que si....y no aporta nada a la historia si es que se puede decir que hay una
genuinely such a fun movie. like the fight scenes were incredible and it was definitely never boring. i just wish we could've seen #JusticeForHerSandwich
Overall, a fun, enjoyable movie that proves once again the DCEU still has hope, even though it started off rocky. Don't let the bad reviews stop you from seeing the film and creating your own opinion of it.
A little predictable. But good storyline and comedy bits.
Was a bit unsure if they really needed to make this movie however it was better than I thought although not among the best of the DCEU. I really liked its action sequences. Robbie is good as the lead Harley Quinn however I felt some of the other characters were under-utilised eg Huntress. Overall it’s a typical sit back have fun popcorn flick with a funky soundtrack to boot
Bad casting
bad acting
Bad pick pocketing
Just bad
Merry mayhem!  Aside from Harley Quinn, the movie's take on the Huntress is really funny too.  I love the DC multiverse!
All over the place story line, but the characters really kicked butt! Loved seeing Harley as an actual hero, and the introduction of Huntress and Black Canary, was well worth it!
It was very stupid and dosent make any sense but it was pure fun. It was very interesting and never was boring. Margot Robbie did an amazing job as Harley Quinn. It was very funny and the action was awesome. I enjoyed it. But it should've called The Fantabulous Harley Quinn and Birds of Prey (it was Harley Quinn movie, not birds of prey one).
Good movie and action.   Marketing should have been better for this film as well as an improved title.
I expected the movie to be more “dark.” It was too much of a comedy, my opinion of course.
Fun movie. Better than expected.
so fricken good. did not expect it to be this amazing
Wasn’t good till close to the end 
It's was fast paced and the action was superb! The sound track was so good and when it was done I wanted to just play again and again! It was a fun and colorful good time!
It’s not a must see, but if you’re in the mood to go to the movies it’s a fun watch.
A very fun trip through Harley's crazy adventures. The movie doesn't take itself too seriously and has a vibrant energy that keeps the action moving. The fight scenes are well choreographed as well. Margot Robbie nails the performance of Harley and her energy and joy for the role is easy to be drawn to. Huntress and Black Canary are interesting and make the most of their screen time, although it's a shame they don't get more. The one big flaw is that Cassandra Cain is in no way a similar character to the comic book version and would have been better served as a new character.
I liked the character Harley Quinn, shes bada.
Crap. The acting and action scenes in my high school play were better. 
twas a great movie. gave me lots of 90's vibes
Theres gonna be people who watch this and force that women good white men bad agenda on it, i say who cares. its a movie and a good one at that.
A fun movie. It is very violent but it has fun with itself similar to Deadpool and Thor Ragnarok. Margot Robbie is an amazing Harley Quinn. She has perfectly nailed that character. 
Terrible ! Over acted mainly due to bad script. Loved Margot in Suicide Squad but this movie was one big cliche of her character.
Great action movie with solid comedy. A few of the scenes were uneven, but overall a fun time.
It was all staged with a predictable plot line... not very exciting
you know what? for reals? could be better
It was enjoyable but wouldn’t watch a second time
To much “girl power” and not enough energy into the actual movie. Like most comic movies they fall flat in setting up a good “bad guy” and giving them a true understanding of why the do what they did. Was still a fun movie with a few LOL moments. Probably the best part is the sound track.
Garbage do not waste you time. This should have been release on TV.
Jesus christ what a shit movie, how the hell does it have such high reviews?
It was terrible save your money and see something else.
I wish they had the umph to do a stand alone Birds of Prey movie and a separate Harley movie as it was originally conceived. I would have loved to see a story more centered on Huntress and Black Canary (and Batgirl/Oracle) than having them be background players. This felt more like a Harley movie with Birds of Prey smashed in a the last minute than a fully fleshed out concept.
I enjoyed the movie! I only have three minor problems. 
1. A bit slow. 
2. Huntress and Cassandra aren't developed as much as they should be. 
3. The team only comes together at the final battle.

But... everything else is spot on! DC's on the right track!
Was it the best comic book movie? Nah. But I'm not mad I spent money on it. It was funny and I laughed and it gave me exactly what I wanted
Storyline was good but could have had better acting
A super fun, super violent time at the movies. Tone is a bit uneven, but worlds better some of the earlier offerings of the DCEU
plenty of action and yet still unpredictable.  Thumbs up in my book.
I loved this movie. Amazing action, completely hilarious and so much fun!!!
I appear to be the minority but I wasn’t a huge fan of the movie. The story wasn’t all that good and the acting seemed over-done at times. There were however a few funny parts and I liked the Canary character. I was a huge fan of suicide squad so I may have gone in with my expectations a little high.
Really solid world building. Gotham City felt like the Gotham of Batman: TAS. Terrific ensemble cast!
THE MOVIE WAS AMAZING, FUNNY AND A LOT OF ACTION.
The acting was good, but the script was only alright. Better than Suicide Squad if for nothing more than having a coherent script and no swirling trash sky vortex.
It was alright, but the characters should have worn the costumes from the comics and black mask should have acted like the Black Mask from the comics.  Try reading the source material before making a movie about it.
Loved this movie. Absolutely hilarious Margot and Ewan are incredible in their roles. So many hilarious jokes throughout. Harley is well portrayed and this is a Gotham I would want to explore. Very well done! Such a shame it isn’t making more money. Deserves more attention.
We enjoyed it!  After so many years of men beating up the bad guys, it was fun to see some women knock them down.
I thought the movie was great, I took my daughter, she had a great time, the soundtrack is awesome, I actually went out the next day and purchased the soundtrack CD, again highly recommended. Sure there were a few parts that I was expecting something a little different. But for a comic book movie, I thought it was well done and original in its delivery. Will be purchasing a hard copy of the movie when it's out on BluRay.
This is the most innovative movie I've seen in years.  Loved it.  In fact, I would have wanted this to be the Oscar winner if it were released sooner.
The movie is amazing! The soundtrack is wonderful, the storyline and special effects are wonderful. I expected nothing less from a film with a strong female cast and produced by women.  Birds of Prey is just wonderful!
Just like RDJ is Iron Man, Margot Robbie is Harley Quinn. She plays the role really well. Story and character development was really good. Format played like the first Deadpool movie and I entertained throughout the whole movie. Loved the action sequences and great music accompaniment. I actually wanna watch it again. Already pre-ordered it on itunes.
Wonderful, funny, violent, and Margot Robbie is amazing. The soundtrack rocks!
Love the action and comedy and never tired of seeing Margo Robbie
incredible!  And excellent performance by Margot Robbie
I thought there would be more.
a lot of potential nothing done well
The characters are absolutely dreadful. The flashbacks can make you forget where you are in the story and the ending makes me assume a real Birds of Prey movie will be coming out with a switched up roster. Either way, if they do make another movie, I will definitely skip it.
Really fun movie. The action sequences are amazing!
A little slow in a few places, but overall pretty good.
The movie was just fun to watch from start to finish. A great intro to the birds of prey and harleys separation from the joker.
Loved it 
Action/Sexy Scenes/ Comedy 
Guys you will like the fights and blood 
Women will love the dialogue and empowerment of women
Fun, fast-paced with excellent fight choreography; one of the best stand alone comic book character adaptations.
I feel like the plot wasn't put together well. It felt like most of the movie was explaining the buildup to the main plot points and then the movie ended. Introducing new DC characters to the world of cinema had a lot of potential and it feels like the characters were just thrown in your face and you didn't have much of an emotional connection to care about them or their origin stories. If you come into this movie with no knowledge of the DC universe then it'll probably be a fun bone-snapping action movie.  And since it is in the DCEU it feels very loosely connected to the other films and you can't help but think it's trying it's best to be DC's answer to Deadpool. Ewan McGregor and Margot Robbie still did great jobs in their roles, I just wish their characters were expanded more so you could care more about them.
Ouch! Why do anything with it or add any other comic book characters other than Harley if you’re just going to waste them? The plot wasn’t any special, costume design wasn’t appealing or anything resembling the source material. Soundtrack was ok though (honestly best part of the movie sadly). Should have been a Harley Quinn solo movie...
high octane fun. tough female action
Gotham was not dark it was fun and crazy from eyes of Harley ♥️♥️♥️ 

Watch it 👀 For fun ride ..DC makes a pop corn movie good 😬😬
Loved it. Lead actress is phenomenal!
it was a good movie, thought it might have tried to hard on the girl gang factor. it was a fun ride,and lot of excitment and action. But everyone bitched about siucide squad that made 740 mil, doubt this will come close.
My whole family loved it! Some language but we all laughed heartily! Super fun movie! 
had a blast!
Entertaining good action some forgettable characters unfortunately. Storyline is okay but watchable.
This movie was amazing. I really enjoyed the plot and it was serious but fun at the same time. The ending was okay, it ended too quick and feel like they shouldve all stayed together.
Fun as hell. GREAT ACTION SCENES. Breakfast sandwich love. Go see it!
NOT GOOD! NOT GOOD! NOT GOOD!
Constant comic book action with absolutely no suspense. Oh no, 100 bad guys against Harley, what will happen? Guess.
Lots of fun. DC's answer to Deadpool.
I LOVED this movie! It was fun from the get-go. Characters, soundtrack, color schemes... I couldnt get enough. The somewhat haphazard timeline in the beginning fit perfectly with Harleys character. I also love the Huntress because I feel I relate to her. 
The main theme of the movie (in my opinion) is each of these women figuring out who they are. Each was struggling from her current circumstances and trying to get back to a normal life. And the action scenes were a BLAST! I felt like I was experiencing everything right there with them. As a woman, I have never felt this connected to a superhero (or antihero) movie! Not even Wonderwoman could compare. Didnt want it to end!!!!!
It would of been cool to see if they added more DC characters.
good choreography terrible movie
It was awesome! Deadpool 2 combined with John Wick 2 and bamf ladies kicking butt! Pure fun!
constant action,  great fight scenes!
Only cool parts are from the John Wick team; however, a very tired and trite script matched with uncharismatic actors makes this a hard pass.
In the age of superhero films, ‘Birds of Prey' fights the norms of other films by tailoring itself as a movie spotlighting the misfits and underdogs. The two things most of comic book-based films lack are both realistic characters and well-developed female lead characters. The comedic approach of the main character brings life throughout most the movie. But it does struggles during select scenes to balance both comedy and story narration. ‘Birds of Prey' offers a refreshing approach to action blockbuster movies with it's mature tone and enjoyable cast.
This gave a. great perspective for Harley and also gave us new characters to look forward to in the future.
We all loved the movie. Action packed but yet you felt sad for her.  Its a must see. Cant wait for it to come on Fandango Now to buy it!
The movie was actually good and I enjoy it very much it’s basically the dc version of Deadpool and had some bones cracks and ya
loved the action and intriguing characters! badass and fun ride
10/10 loved every second.
Supper fun to watch from beginning to end, Margot was born to play harley.
Led by an enthusiastic performance we've come to expect from Margot Robbie, Birds of Prey manages to elevate its generic plot with well-choreographed action and entertaining characters who prove to be a welcome addition to the DC Universe.
I think this and Wonder Woman are probably the best of the DC movies. Me and a friend I saw it with both liked it. This movie won't make you a DC fan, but if you think you might like it, you probably will. Margot Robbie does a great job, Ewan McGregor is insane. The other characters are too much of a stereotype to be entertaining. But overall, it was fun, some great bits of manic craziness.
Sarcasm to the fullest....
Love the movie, must see! 👍👍
Poor script, bad acting, I selected half of a star for the action scenes involving Margot Robbie only
It's good to watch
It was funny the way they fight
Yeah,that's all
I love the pacing and they made the large number of character feel manageable. I really loved that.
It's good. ‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎
This movie is great! Action is solid, the story moves, and the humor is well done. Margot Robbie acts the hell out of this movie! Go see it!
Loved everything about it. Enjoyed the comedy, action, and story.
Growing up a comic book nerd I've always loved characters like Huntress, Black Canary and Harley Quinn. I honestly never thought I would be able to see these characters on the big screen, especially not after the Birds of Prey CW show (which I LOVED as a child) didn't do as well as everyone thought it would. But this movie is just spectacular. I appreciated that they didn't feel the need to make a storyline so elaborate. I am tired of so many movies have a twist or some element that makes it so unnecessarily complicated. I went to this movie to be entertained and my god it did the trick. Do I have a few grievances? Yes. Do I expect perfection from comic book movies? No, because no matter how "realistic" they try to make it, at its core it's source material leads it to defy real world logic/physics. Was it a perfect comic book movie? To me? It's the closest I have felt in a while. And this is coming from someone who loves Endgame and the other MARVEL movies. I think this movie is important to a lot of people and I am so grateful that it was made. Visually? Stunning. Acting? Beautiful. I have never loved Ewan McGregor more. And the ladies?!? Dynamite. The characters made me believe this world was real. Gotham felt like a real place and not just an exaggerated copy of New York filled with cheesy characters (there's still plenty of cheese. But it's the good 6 months past expiration type of cheese ❤️🖤). The fight choreography blew my mind and I can't stop replaying the big fight scene at the end in my head over and over again. If any movie deserved a pop up type thing, it was this one. If you are hesitant about seeing it, just go in with an open mind and be ready to laugh...and possibly get just slightly squeamish but hey, isn't that what Harley is all about? ❤️
It was  a fun  movie but a bit slow at times.  Margo Robie rocks.
It was similar to a deadpool narrative. I loved it just the right amount of action. I see though we're switching to girl power! I love it!
Ewan was amazing! This movie is fun and silly and we had a great time.
So I wasn’t going to see this movie cause well the movies that came before also the trailers are terrible but I took a chance and here we are it’s awesome totally comic come to life and some brutal violence just an all around fun PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF SCIENCE GO SEE THIS MOVIE ITS ACTUALLY GOOD!
It was good afternoon matinee!
Bringing some colour to DC movies!
Margot Robbie was great as Harley Quinn, as she always is. It's almost as I feel she was born to play that role. The action sequences in the movie were done very well, as were the visual effects, which appeared to rely more on practical effects than CGI. The story was told pretty well, though rushed a bit, in certain parts. They introduced two classic D.C. villains who have not gotten much movie screen time in the past, to my knowledge. The movie could have benefited from being slightly longer, which would have given them time to expand on the back stories of the supporting characters, mainly the other members of the Birds of Prey. The main villain could have been made a bit more menacing. But, everything worked out in the end to make this movie a really enjoyable watch. Hopefully, this isn't the last we see of the Birds of Prey.
Kind of didnt make sense for parts of the movie, but its a good chick flick film to see with all of your girlfriends on a weekend.
muy divertida, sarcástica, violenta y genial.
I saw the movie and it was the biggest disappointment of 2020 so far. 

None of the characters were faithfully portrayed. Margot and DC just hijacked the Birds of Prey film and slapped Harley's name on it. It had nothing true to Harley other than I'm crazy and nods to New 52 and some Rebirth but nothing else of substance. We just gonna rip off Deadpool and have Girl Power just because. 

Wonder Woman and Captain Marvel were good examples of Girl Power. This film, however, was garbage from the penning of the script to the final cut of the film. The reshoots are more than apparent and the action scenes are the only things worth mentioning, but that's because of the John Wick director. 

The story is scrambled because of the last minute edits and the Birds of Prey are robbed of their own screen time. This film sucked. HARD.

Everything was bad. True DC fans that don't have to look up Wikipedia summaries on characters can tell that none of the characters were portrayed faithfully. The closest were Montoya and Black Canary but they were too generic with nothing that made them shine as Renee and Dinah.

If only the studio wanted the audience to be emotionally invested in characters rather than shoehorning them in with 40 minutes of screen time... cumulative...for 4 supporting characters. DC and WB will never learn.
Disappointment!  Garbage!
fun action romp with great characters. well worth your time and will leave you wanting more.
It was all around fantastic!!!
I Already Loved Harley But This Movie Made Me Love Her Even More. I Think This Is An Amazing Movie.
The first live action movie that the character genuinely feels like Harlie Quinn.
Hilarious and lots of girl power!
This is a very stylish, fun ride. The story is pretty straight forward and completely coherent. Unlike it's predecessor, Suicide Squid, the writing/editing feels tight and well thought out.

Even though this there are lots of characters, Margot Robbie flexes a ton of range in every scene she's in.

The action is also top notch. I can only imagine what kind of training Robbie went through to pull some of the moves in the fighting scenes. If you enjoy some of the real bone crunching blows of John Wick, this movie is for you.

I think I'll be checking out the soundtrack to this one as there were plenty of great tracks that brightened scenes throughout the movie.

Unfortunately, I don't think the villains are very interesting in this movie.
I thought they stayed true to each of the characters and it entertained me the whole way through. Great fun from start to finish!
Awful.  Boring story.  Forgettable cast. Are we forgetting how to make movies and instead we are making educational videos.  ENOUGH ALREADY.
Who the hell would watch this train wreck? I want my money back!
Love the non stop action
Women fighters were great and adversaries become aligned. But the R rating takes away the people most likely to enjoy, younger children.
Harley queen was great
Must see for adults, def not children. Great comedy and wasnt trying to make itself into something its not like all previous DC movies have been, a fun movie to watch.
This movie is why actors get paid up front, not on how well the movie performs. Not even Margo Robbie's irrepressible enthusiasm and ebullient personality can save this mashup of repetitive swinging from wires and green screen magic.
Inventive, fun addition to the DC Universe.
I liked that there were very powerful women portrayed and that the writer and director were both women! I did wish there were more of the other characters rather than mostly Harley, but I think there is a good set up if they are to do more movies with the Birds of Prey in the future. Overall, a great movie with good character development and badass women.
The movie was an absolute blast to watch. Margot is amazing as Harley and Ewan McGregor was having the time of his life playing Black Mask.
Amazing acting, great action, however huntress needed more screen time and black canary.
Fun, movie! Girl power...
Pudo haber sido mejor, tuvo un argumento confuso y no cumple con la expectativa de la clasificación que tiene.
It had action, some comedy, and a good story that brought the unlikely group together.  It was a fun movie to watch.
It was just OK. Not a flop, but not the great I was hoping for.
They played heavy into some deadpool tropes, and girl power which is good buuuutttt also made things kind of predictable.. Margot Robbie and the other actresses are brilliant, however the writing overall wasnt my favorite, and the ending was weak imo
It was an awesome movie! The characters were well fleshed out and it gave a totally different perspective of Gotham. There were great set pieces filled with action, and enough humor to make you laugh, anyone who loves DC Comics, as well as Batman, will love this movie.
Cool movie, and awesome Margot Robbie!
I couldn't decide if I liked it or not.  It was one of those movies that was entertaining so you don't feel disappointed spending money on it, but it wasn't what I expected either.
Great movie. Never seen something with this kind of feel to it. Definitely earns its R rating, but not how I expected. Definitely worth seeing though.
Overall it was unnecessarily violent! The first half was mediocre and the last third, because of the calisthenics and cinematography, was okay!!! Why do the film makers believe we have to see such violence? Unimpressed by the acting!
A female driven take on a comic book movie, loved the cast and the sizzling, manic energy Margot brings to the role- Jurnee Smollett is great as Black Canary, and Rosie Perez is a delightful play on the rugged cop. The plot was slightly convoluted, but ultimately, the brilliant fight scenes and lack of special effects trickery prove that heart, good fight choreography and great acting can best millions of dollars being thrown on a computer screen. A good DC movie!
Went in thinking it would be completely trash - left pleasantly surprised. 

Opening scene very good fun then slowly dwindled. Slight step in a different direction from DC carried off fairly well.
Disliked some slow-played out action scenes...
Margot Robbie was the only decent part of the movie for us.  The writing was fairly boring and movie felt disjointed.  I enjoyed Harley in Suicide Squad and Joker and thought this could have some real potential. Sadly, I was mistaken.
This movie was awesome!  DC finally has their answer to Deadpool, Harley is just as funny and has all the right moves to lead this group of bad-ass ladies in what is the 2nd best DC film to date.  Brash, beautiful and bursting with crude humor, don't sleep on Birds of Prey, it's the kind of movie we need right now.
The plot was better than I expected dim the cinematography was very good.
It was better than Suicide Squad so there’s something to look forward to. That aside it was a decent movie for a comic book movie led by a female cast
The only good things in the movie is the music, Black Mask, action, and that’s it. Everything else kinda sucks they ruined Huntress as a character, Harley is even more annoying than ever, Black Canary was eh, the dective whose name I can’t remember was okay, the pickpocket character was so boring, and that’s it. Suicide Squad was so bad you can make fun of it, but not this. This is pretty terrible
Is amazing movieeeeeee
We loved it!! Had a great time with the daughter & granddaughter for a girls night at the movie!!
I took 8 sixteen year old boys. OMG!, they are in love. They absolutely enjoyed Birds of Prey. Harley Quinn is the new IT girl. They want to see it again. I only gave it 4 stars because my 50 year old husband wasnt as thrilled. He said very entertaining, but not the best movie per set. The boys said its just because he did not understand the Batman underlying story.
Very uneven bag of good and bad, unfortunately mostly bad. It has some good scenes, few fun jokes and fights. Unfortunately most of the time the movie trips and stumbles into the very basic no-nos of moviemaking on many levels. Some of the choices especially during fight scenes make absolutely no sense.
Needed more of a plot
Well it's like a messed up burlesque, with a lot of glam shots ofc. The plot is boring as hell. The girls, indeed, were hot. Do I recommend seeing this in theatre? Absolutely no. DC failed hard as a movie franchise to Marvel, period.
This movie's casting is great, action scenes and stunt work are great, and at times the scripting is funny enough. If that's enough for you, then you'll love the film. But for those who watch franchise films to invest in long-term continuity and storytelling with high stakes and consequences, you don't get it here. Needless to say: SPOILERS AHEAD.

I want DC to be better, but it just hasn't been, and here's why:

1. Character relationships to actions make no sense.
There's a lot to nitpick but the one that's most vivid in my head is the scene where the unnamed mobsters chase Harley and Cassandra at the Booby Trap. They spot the two running between some shelves, and immediately unload several clips, obviously missing every shot, before stopping and saying, "Go get them. Bring the girl back alive." Alive? You just emptied a clip trying to shoot her.

2. Character motivation needs more work.
In particular, Detective Montoya's character. She seems like the film's moral north. She cares about justice and cleaning up Gotham's streets, but decides to leave the police force to join the Birds of Prey because? I understand being snubbed by men repeatedly, but it's not like the force was colluding for the diamond. They were just incompetent. That would make a character frustrated for sure, but it wouldn't flip them from a jolly do-gooder to a vigilante overnight. She wouldn't even let Cassandra have a margarita in the last scene, and I'm supposed to believe she would be in cahoots with lawless assassins?

3. Consequence.
This is a bit nitpicky because it happens in all comic book films, but scenes where the main character effortlessly trashes a bunch of no-name bad guys gets tiresome really quickly. Action should be used to create consequences for the future, not because the writer/director doesn't know how to get to the next scene, which is what this really felt like. The last battle scene didn't even make sense.

Presumably Sionis "owns" Gotham, right? He's got a half a million dollar bounty on Quinn's head, and he's after a diamond that would lead him to a fortune, yet the "army" he hired doesn't have guns? Why would they raid the Booby Trap with a bunch of baseball bats? There's no way that scene shouldn't have been a hail of bullets.

As I mentioned in the preface, the movie is at the least entertaining. Margot Robbie was great casting. I can overlook the blatant girl power injected into every line of the script because it's 2020, yay empowerment. But the overall quality of the story structure needs a lot of work to be great. Right now it's just okay.
Not good, all style, no substance. Save your money for Wonder Woman or Black Widow.
The characters were spot on. But the story line was a bit thin
Great movie! Funny, action packed, with cool cinematography. It was definitely a Gotham City movie. One of my favorite comic book movies, now.
It was so funny and definitely showed Harley Quinn’s growth
I promise my next review will be for something I enjoy. For some reason it's bad movies that trigger the emotional response to write a review. I think it's because I want to save you and help to avoid negatively impacting your life. 

Birds of Prey was so so bad. I never walk out on movies but in the case of this one, I came pretty darn close. Margot and Ewan do a pretty good job considering the trash script they're working with. The rest of the cast are mediocre at best. The scene transitions, plot, and pace of the film are all poorly done. Leave it to DC to continually bomb and waste the great catalog of characters available to them under their brand. At what point do you decide to take a page from Marvel and actually commit yourself to making a great movie. Idk, I'm done with DC. If not for Wonder Woman, the entire brand would be dead.
The premise was rather weak, but the action and dialog sort of made up for it.
just too much bs.   kicking and fighting over and over.   boring.  my husband fell asleep.
Its intense, crazy, and has you asking for more.
Great Fun! Hubby and I had such a good time we took family and friends to see it twice. Fantastic acting, amazing stunts, lots of laughs and lots of quirky odd bits that fit right in! High energy!
Pure crap!! Great deception from a DC supporter
This movie is boring and uninspired. No wonder it's doing so poorly on sales.
It’s hyper violent, it’s R-rated, it’s hilarious. The whole cast does an excellent job, especially Ewan Mcgregor as Black Mask. You can see the inspiration from Deadpool. If you have been struggling through DC movies, please go see this one, it will restore your faith.
Watchable but totally all over the place. But at very least the bonkers element still there! 
I loved every minute of it.  Margot is perfect once again as Harley.   A visual circus of mayhem and crazy.  It is deliciously violent while still having heart and character development.  Harley is the female Deadpool.
This is an incredibly well made movie! And Margo Robbie just stole the show as Harley Quinn! Incredible fights scenes packed with Harley Quinn's narration to whole movie tied the movie into an awesome packed action film. I have never seen an female led movie with such powerful action sequences. It's incredible! I'm watching this again!
Characters and action.
great movie. good action never a dull moment. Great job DC.
Not sure why the ratings are so low on other sites. I enjoyed this movie. The fight scenes were really well done.
It was a great movie. Funny with a lot of action. Something you'd want to see on the big screen.
too ,much violence, too much vulgarity, not enough story.   I expected an action movie, not  a woman beats up everyone movie. Take that away and you have nothing.  I want my money back!
I enjoyed it! It’s a good Valentine’s Day type of movie
This movie has everything: comedy, costumes, action, and amazing cinematography! A must-see!
I absolutely loved the movie, but I am glad I did not take my kids. I believe the movie could have curbed a lot of the language and it would have been just as good if not better. However I would still go back and watch it, and still plan to buy it once it hits DVD and digital platforms.
Two words: Margot Robbie
The movie was enjoyable and a fun watch.  All the action and humor and fun makes it a "must go and see" movie.  Really liked it!
It is a fun movie with good rhythm and great action.
This is not a Birds of Prey movie that features Harley Quinn. It's a Harley Quinn movie that fails to properly set up the Birds of Prey at the end, and it's a bad one at that. Everything about this movie screams desperation from Warner Bros. and it fails to get simple things right like a coherent script, respect for the characters/source material, etc. This movie was a giant waste of an opportunity. The people making this have no clue what they are doing nor do they know anything about these characters and the world they're from. Bottom line, there's too much stupid to enjoy this movie and too much disrespect for the characters to give this movie a pass on any (if any) of its good merits. Skip this movie and pretend it doesn't exist. Don't waste your time or money.
going in with a pretty great grasp of the characters, I had expectations for the film. I am happy to say that it far exceeded them! though Cassandra is nothing like she is in the comics, she was delightful, and the entire cast did a tremendous job making a living, believable world of Gotham where Amusement Mile exists. Black Mask and Zsasz were in full sadistic form. delightfully fun, colorful depth, and excellent presentation!
Borung characters and a shitty story
This is a must see! The girls are amazing and Cathy send us a good piece of action!
To much back an forth.
Weak plot, rambling action.  Rather forgetable.
Such promise. Such potential. Failed to deliver from the beginning. Script, directing, acting all went wrong in their own ways combining to make a film leaving you wondering why you spent money to see it. The talk of others as I left echoed my thoughts -this movie was not good.
Not action the story line is very basic and for awhile it is very hard to follow. A few funny moments but over all just a ok movie not a action packed DC movie we are use to seeing
It was not what I think it was going to be and they did not went by the comics books. DC can do better
Fun movie. Wish it wasn't rated R. Would attract more audience.
great movie to watch if youre you like comedy and action. It also displays feminist values.
There was no real plot or character development.
It was a Harley Quinn movie and very overated. The rest of cast came in later and was decent at best. Only MARGINALLY better than Suicide Squad. Margo did a great job as Harley though.
Fun but not much more than that. 
perfeitooooooooooooooooooooo
Good action, decent story, no complaints...
So much fun!  If you only see one comic book movie in 2020 see this one.
Birds of Prey appears to be an exciting romp of female characters, showing what ‘bad girls can do…and unfortunately what we see, except for Harley Quinn at times, is that they're wimpy, emotional, pathetic little girls, nothing new here!

While Harley fights, her best moves at near the beginning of the movie, otherwise the so-called combat is obvious fake and painful slow/predicable.  This last part is true of ALL the other girls who maybe want to show you where they come from and where they're going, but I can't be certain. Is what frustrating to know how the director wanted me to see them so eventually I settled on wimp & bland from start to finish. No one stood out as heroic/anti-hero, whatever the F you want to call it. 

I'll say that Black Canary had her moments in fighting and having her Finally use her voice near the end was good. Casse and the cop were an absolute Waste of Space as neither could act and had nothing to contribute to the film…I honestly think you could drop those two and the film would have gone on just fine.

Speaking of disappointing, lack Mask is another bad joke to this film as I see him as more annoying than scary. He never reaches anything close to scary and he feels more like a trouble child who's acting out.

Last, for a rated R film, the violence was bland, so bland that I thought I was watching more of a bad comedy. The levity that the director painful forced into the film was awful and shows that someone shouldn't direct, EVER!
Was action pack but felt it was missing something.
A ton of fun at the movies!
It was fantastic, bounce in my seat, laugh out loud fun. I cant wait to see it again.
I liked this movie because it was well acted by all the female leads. The story line had it' sup and downs but it was well executed. I would definitely see it again. My wife enjoyed it too, we had so much fun laughing and enjoyed the action scenes by Margot Robbie/Harley Quinn. 
Thank you Fandango for the 4 dollar bday coupon I used to see the movie. 
Also, it's pretty sad that allot of people did not go see it, In my opinion, because it was a female movie. I would say this movie was better than Suicide Squad.  Please get out there and see it.
Good fun weekend flick for a bit a fun. The girlfriend loved the flick me,  I thought it was just okay. Kept hoping the new Joker would show up in the film.
The movie was okay, but nothing spectacular. DC Comics made a movie about some of its very minor characters, which has a great appeal to comics fans, but everyday moviegoers aren't going to flock to this one. The acting was decent, but predictable as was the plot line. Special effects were nice and the fight scenes were exciting as well. After seeing this one in the theater, I realized I could easily have waited on it to come out on DVD and been just as happy. I don't think I could give this 5 stars, even if Margot Robbie was naked for at least an hour.
It was alright not quite what I expected, wouldnt put it above suicide squad.
Did I see the same movie as everyone else?
The first third of the movie I would give three stars and the last third I would give four stars.  I love that it was mostly females kicking ass!
Solid film. The fight sequences were John wick with less bullets. Harley Quinn can carry a movie.
boring movie and waste of time
Honestly, I thought except for Margret Robbie, the cast wasn't exactly good. But after watching the movie, I realize how horribly wrong I was. Acting was really good, and the way the story progressed was great in my opinion.


An absolute joyride of a movie! Delivers on what it promises without goin' overboard on feminism. Margot as Harley is SPECTACULAR! Overall a must watch! ♥️♥️♥️



dc is back in action after the release of aquaman. hope they continue this flow and yeah RELEASE THE SNYDERCUT
because Snyder is man with great vision
well that's harlequin for you !! it's a must watch movie ,it's crazy and badass !!!
Perfectly teaming up the DCEU



Harley at its best.. Nice and awesome movie.. Worth a watch.. A bonanza for a DC fans... A best comeback for Harley after a broke up with Joker... Complete entertainment for the watchers...
Most of the dc comics were so indulging every aspect of the story line .. but in this they bring of the fantabulous emancipation of harly Quinn. The movie is amazing and actions sequences were so well made by all the cast members.


fun


The movie is light, funny and action packed. The movie justifies the comics according to my knowledge and has been up to my expectations. The movie is a introduction movie to the upcoming dc universe... so keep your hopes set according if you're reading this review and planning to watch movie. 
The action was just fabulous. Really reminded me of John wick which is class apart movie. 
Overall movie is awesome but it's a quote short movie. 
Definitely a weekend movie for me and worth spending money. Could be watched at home but the action scenes were great on big screen. 
Way to go DC.


it was very good, way better than Shazam.

l like the direction & screenplay...also love for Maggot Robbie...❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️⚫⚫⚫⚫⚫⚫❤️❤️❤️💚🧡💚💚💙💜🖤🔴🔵🖤💜💙💚💚💛💚💙💜💜💚💛🧡🧡💚💙💛🧡🧡❤️🧡💙💜💚💚
Super director, superb acting, didn't loose the flavour throughout the movie! must watch. a totally Harley-Quinzel-experience..! DC is getting better with it.
The movie was an absolute delight to watch. Specially the storytelling format with awesome visuals complemented each other very well. It’s a must watch film for all the Harlequin fans



Very entertaining movie. Harley Quinn shoots glitter, paint out of her gun and throws punches (and kicks) and manages to get herself in trouble with almost every baddie in town. Margot Robbie is a livewire and she pulls a badass performance. Overall, it’s a great flick from the DC universe.

Fun packed movie. Actions are really awesome . Finally DC is right on track
Good one


Not a masterpiece. but definitely not boring. one time watch and sarcastic+entertaining. best part is huntress and Harley.❤ totally worth it !!!

Margret Robbie😍,and Background music WAS  superb,ACTION SEQUENCE ARE awesome ,story is very good

gr8 action sequences, gr8 cinematography, Harley queen just nailed it, she is perfect in her role, nobody could do this character except Margot Robbie. nice experience to watch females superheroes.






well made comedy entertainer...

You must be wondering, what can a superhero/villain can get one thinking. Well after watching Birds of prey, I am thinking if this is the worse DC movie I have watched or was it Suicide squad. BOP is so bad that some scenes will make you wanna puke or leave the theatre or both.


horrible had to walk away in the middle of movie.Such a weird story line.And no character properly portrayed.Should have watched another movie .

This movie makes Suicide Squad look like a masterpiece. The soundtrack while good seemed forced on every scene. Margots performance couldn’t carry an otherwise bloated script. She went from menacing to becoming a caricature.
story was a bit slow but every frame of Robbie Margot did a fantastic job she niled it.
action scenes are good it's a one time watch movies it could be better but okay you can watch this movie if you DC enthusiast.



I absolutely loved the movie. It's not often that so many women get to be the central actors in a movie and it really felt so empowering. Margot Robbie's acting was absolutely amazing and you can just forget about the whole plot and just watch her the entire time and feel like you're getting more than your money's worth. That's how good she was. The plot didn't grip me as much as it should have and that's the only reason why I reduced 20%. However, it was an amazing movie.
I'm a Marvel fan and I decided to hate on it. But I was wrong about that. This is one of the best DC movies I've ever seen. It got best action sequences than any other superhero movies. I recommend everyone to see this gorgeous movie. 😰😍😍
Best women’s movie ever made and all the characters are really made for this movie . I loved it . Outstanding performances are appeared in birds of prey ❤️



Seriously no action that make sense specially in the last part. DC has lost it completely. A very simple and basic plot that 80% revolves around post breakup effects of Harley.






























One of the most badass and craziest DC flicks to come out. Highly recommended! Harley Quinn and Dinah Lance a standout. Wished for more of Black Mask.

Really bad direction and writing. Waste of a huge chunk of Margot’s money! Sadly a woman showed that women can only dress up and talk cliches. Could’ve done so much better with the characters and dialogues. Shouldn’t have given a DC character to an inexperienced director.



I love Harley Quinn .. But the story looked like some girlish kids movie or feminist.. I am a Girl don't take me wrong.. but Harley Quinn is Harley Quinn...  I expected more.. some Harley madness...


Decidedly, meh.

If you skip this movie. you will not regret. base less action. No story.  Acting is good though

Had more expectations from DC. Highly predictable and boring. Poor choice of Actresses ( specially the cop). In the end, Marvel Rocks



വളരെ മികച്ച സിനിമാ എന്ന് തന്നെ പറയാം, സജിയുടെ അനാർക്കലി എന്നാ സിനിമാ യുടെ പത്തിരട്ടി മികച്ചു നിന്നു ബിജു മേനോൻ, രഞ്ജിത് പെർഫോമൻസ് വേറെ ലെവൽ ആയി... അട്ടപ്പാടി യുടെ
Movie had a straightforward story with some non linear script. Margot's performance was nice though. Full was alot about visual graphics. Stunts were too cheesy. It's like every mercenary was a good shooter but couldn't shoot Harley with their full efforts. That was completely silly. And making the team of birds of prey was completely unnecessary. It was more like showing the women Power and less of emancipation of Harley Quinn.


Margot Robbie`s Suicide Squad spin-off makes genuine attempts to push cinematic boundaries.
