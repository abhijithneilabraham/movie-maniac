This movie should've been called, "Harley Quinn and the birds of prey" or "Harley Quinn and ... (insert any name here)" because this is not a team based movie at all, it mainly focus on the character of Harley Quinn - sadly not in a meaningful way - and her fight against what can be described as a faded image of Black Mask.I'm OK with making a movie far off the original animations and comic books in what seems to be a shadowed completely different characters who only share their names from the original adaptation but even considering this fact in this movie it's still considered a huge let down on all aspects, from the shallow silly plot to the corny acting by everyone specially "Margot" and the the sexual orientation twists that turns almost every lead male and female character into either bisexual or gay while leaving the rest of the minor male characters to look like jerks which is no more than a sad attempt for female empowerment movie, not to mention the too much colorful scenes and cheesy directing throughout the whole mess.There are many huge missed opportunities here that could've turned this into an amazing piece of art, I believe it was deliberately missed by the childlike script and performance by all adding the all over the place sets decorations and directing.I understand that a Harley movie must be colorful and chaotic but there's a huge difference between artistic anarchy and this mess which feels it was directed by a crazy extravagant fashion designer! The movie had its very few moments though, for example the fight scene in the evidence room which I believe is considered the level that the whole movie should've been developed upon or even darker! not too girly and childish like this one.Harley Quinn is a very dangerous character, sometimes even sometimes more crazy and sadistic than the joker, an unstable yet funny lady in a dark way and what was represented in this film had nothing to do with Harley's character, I don't think this movie will be enjoyed by most fans of Harley Quinn or DC generally, I for one sure didn't enjoy it this much, my opinion is this, "Margot" will never be a true to heart Harley Quinn... she doesn't look the same, she doesn't feel the same and sure as hell doesn't sound the same.Just like people admired "Jack Nicholson" for being the Joker, No one knew back then that there will be "Heath Ledger" and "Joaquin Phoenix" to rule the role on their own way and the same goes for Harley, I believe nerds drool over "Margot" because they didn't see any better versions yet and I'm sure if the role was given to someone else who is close to the original Harley it'll dazzle everyone. I recommend if DC decided to use "Margot" again at least ask her to go learn from "Arleen Sorkin" how to say "Puddin" or "Mr. J" properly and for f's sake just give her a bigger adult oversized mallet for some wild skull crushing instead of that childish toy she had to hit people with!






I like women. I like equality.
I don't like idiotic political agendas like "all women good - all men bad".
Besides that, the whole feels cheap and stupid. Margot is an excellent actor so I think this was a missed opportunity to make something cool. They should have learned from the Joker.






I was one of the many fans of Margot Robbie who was wowed by her initial performance as Harley Quinn and looked with anticipation for the character's return. I never imagined the pathetic sequel that has been released. EVERYTHING IS TERRIBLE! The Director and the Scriptwriter who created this stink bomb should be banished from Hollywood and Margot should have held out for a better script instead of accepting her payday. Very disappointing.






They were most likely warner bross bots trying to pull this garbage by ears from pits of low-scoresAbout 10.000 watchers (not counting lunatics/bots with 10/9 stars) though this movie is good or very good.Makes me wonder. Do people REALLY think this is good? or is this some kind of leming rush combined with lack of proper sense?This movie preys on all people affected by the twisted feminist ideology.It's just bad.






Target demographic (12-17 year old girls)Movies rating (R18+)Whoever thought this was a good idea definitely needs to reconsider. Your own audience couldn't see it.It's easily the worst of the 8 DC films to date. You want female empowerment watch Wonder Woman.






It's your regular feminist anti male propaganda. That is literally a spoiler. Don't waste yoru money on this crap. Wait a minute .... you didn't. It bombed.
What a joke of a movie. Boring slow dull and the plot is daft jumps from one scene to another with no interest. How can any critic that's says this is good be genuine cause there no way they are.






The plot is so simple that everything that happens, happens for the sake of the plot.Nothing is interestingNothing is newNothing is creativeEven the action is dull and boringThe acting could not save the boredom of this movie !!!






Before we saw this movie, my son told me that there were lots of 1/10 reviews on IMDb from people who hadn't even seen the film. Well, here's a 1/10 review from someone who has.Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn reminds me a lot of Lori Petty in Tank Girl (1995), another comic book film that really ground my gears. Like Petty's character, every quirky mannerism and snarky comment by Harley got right on my tits, as did her horrible fashion sense. In addition to Robbie's diabolical performance, we get equally obnoxious turns from Rosie Perez as a tough cop, Ella Jay Basco as an annoying pick-pocket, and Ewan McGregor as camp crime boss Roman Sionis, plus an absolutely pointless tribute to Marilyn Monroe, lots of dumb, supposedly amusing captions, a tiresome self-aware voice-over, and a horrible CGI hyena.Director Cathy Yan (who?), working from a charmless script by Christina Hodson, is unable to do anything interesting with the admittedly wafer-thin plot, which can be boiled down to just a handful of words: "everyone is looking for a diamond".A muddled, noisy, gaudy mess, full of poorly constructed action scenes and goofy humour that falls flat on its face, Birds of Prey is possibly the worst film I have seen at the cinema in recent months. And I saw Cats and Bombshell (another Margot Robbie disaster).






This movie was awful. It's a jumbled mess of missed jokes and shoving girl power and "men are evil' down your throat. There isn't one male in this entire movie that isn't some kind of evil misogynist caricature.You can raise women up without doing that. GOOD movies about strong females make good money because people enjoy them, men as well. But when you go the route of wokeness from the promotion to the actual film, you're going to suffer at the box office....then blame the people you're alienating. It's a clown show.Who is this movie aimed at? Most of the woke crowd don't really want to see it, you alienate your biggest audience and then complain that they don't want to go see it? Make good movies instead of using them to inject your agenda into entertainment.Maybe if they keep losing money they will learn...probably not.The best things about this movie was a CGI Hyena and MEW.






Train wreck of a movie. Robbie looked like she was trying to be an extra in My Name Is Earl. Seriously, Jamie Presley would have done a way better job. The only thing that was ok about this film was the soundtrack. Best way to describe this movie would be mix Deadpool, Boondocks Saints, Suicide Squad and Charlie's angels together, mix in some really really bad acting and you get this gem






Women beating the **** of evil men for almost 2 hours. If you interested in that concept then this movie is for you.There was no joke in this movie.. none. That alone is an achivement i guess. Creating a movie about one of the funniest DC characters and nobody laughed not even once.Harley was ok, a bit crazy and that's all the positives i can say about this garbage.It felt like a female deadpool wannabe movie but without even a well wrtitten story or good fight scenes, or humor and or a single interesting character to be honest except Harley...
Yep, even black mask was garbage.
While Margot Robbie is a good Harley Quinn, the character was not given enough arc. The plot was predictable and mainstream, especially due to lack of a strong antagonist. The main antagonist, played by Ewan McGregor, was not developed and hence did not add significant value to the plot story. Although some of the fight scenes were entertaining, the film as a whole was truly forgettable.






Some of the action scenes were okay. Nothing special I was really hoping to see something worth watching. This is quite a disappointment. A lot of hype as usual What can I say? I'm just hoping when Venom comes out. I'll have something to enjoy. I don't recommend of this one.






Straight comparison to suicide squad : this movie's total mess..Horrible script, lack of characters development even there are some attempts yet miserably failed, wasted main villain potential, and so on..Now Wonder Woman 1984 has a tough burden to redeem this junk.






Margot Robbie is pretty awesome as Harley Quinn however even with that, this movie is one step up from unwatchable. The plot is all over the place, the dialogue is horrible, the characters other than Harley Quinn are inconsequential, and basically the producers are just spitting in the eye of anybody who has been a fan of the comics. There were a couple good laughs and a couple good fight scenes but otherwise this really was nothing but a loud, garish Suicide Squad spin-off. I'd be all for a real DC Birds of Prey movie, but this film should not even have had that name in the title.






If you like Suicide Squad, this is for you. If not, this is a hard pass. Don't even bother.The good:
Harley Quinn is perfectPerformances are goodit's visually pleasingThe bad:
For being R-rated, the violence feels neuterednot comic accurate at the least, infact it's a huge "f u" to the comicsit's not original, it's just a gender-bent version of Deadpool 2The ending isn't deservedThe story is bland, sloppy, and allover the placeCostumes looked cheap






Add another Box Office Bomb to the long list of Feminist Man Hating Duds. As a woman I have the right to call out This Woketards. We dont want reboots,reduxs, gender swap, man hating movies. We want more movies like Salt, Original Aliens, Original Terminator, Resident Evil, Silence of The Lambs, and other movies that provide a strong female lead or character who ist trying the be a FemiNazi. Is it that hard. No wonder why people are turning against the lame movies being put out. I hope Hollywood continues to Go Woke, cause the will be Broke soon.Another Review From A
Proud Woman of Color.






This could have been such a good movie! The movie took a few steps too many into the woke space. While some of the elements fit in well with the theme, it becomes tiring if the same message is constantly being repeated over and over and over. It simply spoils the movie






Highly disappointing! Margot Robbie in my opinion wasn't at her best as before. Her voice work seemed off & body language seemed restricted & constrained. I felt I got what the director & writer had in their imagination, but it wasn't what came out. The BEST THING about this movie was Mary Elizabeth Winstead's appearance and performance. Evan McGregor was flawless too. Other than them, it felt like every character was under utilized. Most scenes were either hurried or trimmed abruptly. Music at some places was really good and really boring at others. Imo, the points where music was very good needed to be louder. Action didn't excite too much and the props used for that seemed to come out of nowhere. This team had tremendous potential if the story could have been told differently and action scenes were tweaked at some places. With some more inter character tension, this could have been a blockbuster. Hate to say this, but highly disappointing.






I'll just go straight for it, if you're going to downvote this review for defending a genuinely entertaining violent film, i get that. Literally just WATCH THE MOVIE! This movie is anything but a "men are trash" movie. It's a fun flick about a heist where it's all knives at eachothers throats. Genuinely formulaic at times, sure, but that's practically a given for these types of films! Margot Robbie gave a fantastic performance as the Quinn herself, and the side characters had their moments as well! Gotta give a FAT shoutout to McGregor for his role. He brought just as much flame and fire as Margot gave her role. Go ahead and do yourself a favor. This is a good ass time to watch!






Birds of Prey: and the Fantabulous Emancipation of one Harley Quinn, is a movie I had high hopes for but it fell flat. I will start off this review with the positive aspects first such as: Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn was a great casting and continues to be where I think she gives a better performance then her one in Suicide Squad, and Ewan Mcgregor plays a decent version of Black Mask. The use of colours and costumes I thought were great and I found some moments of entertainment through some of its action sequences.However, This film has a lot of problems, most of the performances in this film are very shoddy, especially from Rosie Perez who is a walking cliche' as Renee Montoya (and I know that's what they were going for but it just doesn't work}, and Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Huntress who gives us some very cringey at times acting, and I think some of this has something to do with the screenplay which I also think is average at best. The humour that they're going for doesn't work at all I chuckled maybe once, and it was the same for my theatre. They also butchered Victor Zsasz which I found extremely disappointing as I was looking forward to his inclusion in the DCEU, the way he was portrayed was nothing like how he is in the comics and it seems like he is just trying to be some knock off version of the Joker. Also why is the film titled Birds of Prey? This is a Harley Quinn Movie, just like the trailers the Birds of Prey are barely in it and when they were they had small glimpses of being cool characters but for the most part they were some of the most cliched early 2000's era superhero characters I have seen since that era.Overall, I found Birds of Prey to be a disappointment I came into this film very optimistic but got let down, due to the fact that this films writing was just plain bad. If Margot Robbie's and Ewan Mcgregor's performances weren't as great as what they were with the nice compliments of the characters costumes it would have been completely boring and cliched garbage.






If u want to watch a really bad movie, I recommend this movie.






If you are not driven by the imperative need of understanding precisely what is happening in your movie, you might enjoy this psychedelic mix of disjointed cool visuals, great music, firecrackers, fragments of good acting...
Birds Of Prey is a mess presented in a messy way, it hardly holds together as a story but it offers moments of fun.






The acting was good, most of the actors gave it their all, but the film was just so UGLY. Gave me a headache just looking at it. Also the dialogue was so cringe worthy. It wanted to sound and look edgy, but ended up being a complete mess of a film. Feel sorry for a character with such a strong fan base.






A dud from Warner Bros. The best thing about suicide squad was Robbie's performance but this vehicle is a disservice to the potential that was there. Robbie does her best but the direction, script and editing are not at the requisite level. An interesting character poorly treated by a very lacklustre script. Disappointing.






What an absolute waste of money w the stupidest script. Of all the talented writers that must be out there - why would you choose to produce an obviously idiotic story like this ?? I just don't get it. You have this chance of putting something out there of value - all this sweet Hollywood money and this is the best you can come up with ?? Really ??






With badly driven character arcs and nonexistent plot, "Birds of Prey" is a directionless mess. Instead of showing you a fun and interesting story, they would rather talk you through expository dialogue and narration. Beneath this pile of wasted potential is a sadly missed opportunity for an interesting story about some of DC's most interesting characters. The most compelling part of the movie for me was Hunteress, who had less screen time than an adolescent pick-pocket. But the best part of the film isn't even about the film, but the critics response. Even the top critics, whose job it is to judge movies by their story and characters, say that the fighting was so cool that it makes it a good movie. So then, why isn't Green Lantern considered a good movie? Man of Steel? Suicide Squad? These "critics" are either to dumb to realize an awful movie when they see one, or they're afraid to criticize movies because of the backlash they might get.In conclusion: Don't make the same mistake I did and waste your hard earned money on this two hour long mood swing.






Big Margot Robbie fan and was super pumped for this film yet It was easily the worst movie I've seen in years. Editing was all over the place, every joke fell flat, dialog was cringe, and some terrible acting by the cop lady and the young Asian girl. The high end visuals ewan's job as black mask were the loan positives in this disaster.






I'm only going to say this, birds of a feather, flock off. I'll stick with suicide squad, where Harley at least had the role that was perfect for her character ( Joker's 2 minutes of footage aside ). It was boring, some parts ok i guess, but overall a yawn-fest. Good visuals, not bad in parts ( no spoilers ) but oh my lord did i yawn for the most of it. I actually yearned for Wonderwoman, or even that blithering ugh-fest of a character Batwoman ( the one with monotone and a terrible wardrobe ). It's WB for crying out loud, they have the capital to hit this out of the park, but this got buried instead, we love you ladies, but oh my this could have gone way better. I really do hope the next one gets it right, but these insert group vs insert group movies? they really never go down with couple therapy movie sessions.






It's trying to be a Deadpool movie but it failed Miserably. There are some good action sequences but overall they are nothing like the Birds of Prey. For being a comic book movie it definitely fails. It's a messy movie overall.






I haven't walked out of a film in 30 years, until tonight. About 45 minutes was all I could take. There literally wasn't a single scene that wasn't absolutely stupid in every way.I just there squirming, feeling so embarrassed for Margo. Please do not waste your money on this awful film.






Terrible movie. Another chance for Hollywood Liberals to charge you money to sit in front of their movie and be brain washed. Not worth seeing. Save your money for a real story told well and without the feminist hue to it.






Suggestion, when doing a comic book film using beloved characters make sure to land those characters. You can deconstruct them all you like, but if the heart isn't there you get this instead of "the joker".There is no Birds of prey, at least none recognizable from their source material counterparts. Robbie is not Harley, her 90's trashy grunge gender studies cousin maybe, but not Harley. When a cartoon does better than a multi-million dollar film, you've failed.Over the top man hating new wave feminism and alphabet "representation" for no reason. Action is not believable. Writing is atrocious. Editing is frenetic.If you hated Suicide squad, welcome to its jealous over achieving sister.






I wanted to enjoy this movie, but I couldn't. Bad screenplay, bad CGI and... no story. Waste of money and time at the cinema.






Wow ! Harley was the only solid character in the whole movie and 80% of the movie was her explaining who everyone else was because they made a total $×&t show of the rest of them! Every other character was a complete 180 off the source material (Harley isn't perfect either but at least the accent was there this time) and a 1000% worse... I'm so glad I didn't pay to see this, a friend paid because I refused to go and I was right to. Whoever wrote this deserves to burn, It was at least an actual story unlike Joker.
I hope the new suicide squad is better(it should be due to James Gunn) The least they could have done was make an actual Birds of Prey using the real characters and give Harley Quin her own movie...DC movies are just garbage(aside from Aquaman and Wonder woman) it was bad just avoid it.
I actually paused Winter Soldier to go be offended for an hour and 40 min....DC needs to stick to television and animation and leave the movie business to Marvel.
On that same note tho Marvel TV isn't so good so no I'm not just saying this because I'm a marvel only fan, Batman is My favorite comic character aside from the punisher so yes I wanted to cry when they cast the new Shatman which is what they should call it....Now I'm gonna go cry myself to sleep.






In case Hollywood execs have been hiding under a rock for the past few years, movies that come off as blockbusters, but are just there to shove an agenda down the viewers throats, are always a huge flop. Going all the way back to 2016 with the female Ghostbusters, then the all female Oceans 8, then moving in to Force Awakens and the awful Last Jedi and Rise if Skywalker. These failures insist they are good, and should be watched and praised by everyone simply because the cast is female. The cast and crew refuse to accept how bad their movies are, and insist on its success, despite opinions from anyone who's seen them and disagree. Those of whom are simply labeled women-hating trolls.Birds of Prey is no different. While Kathleen Kennedy is insisting on a female director for the next Star Wars film, as this film had, her sexist persona should be taught that gender, race, political identity and religion should have no say in how the movie is going to perform. Movies are rated by quality, plain and simple. If you have a good script, good acting, good directing, good producing and good editing, the movie will always do well. None of which can be found in Birds of Prey, let alone pretty much all female led films lately.While Hollywood and the left are insisting on pushing straight, strong male leads out of the way in order to push their narrative of strong females, they in turn, sacrifice their films. In other words, they're simply cutting off their noses to spite their face.When is Hollywood going to learn that these movies do not embrace strong females, nor make successful films. They ruin them. If you want to see strong female lead characters in movies, go watch Aliens, Terminator 2 and Underworld. Those were good movies, with very likeable and admiral female leads, that didn't shove their narrative all in your face.Birds of Prey is another strong female film failure, with awful acting and non-believable characters. The film, as so many others have done, purposefully make the male characters weak and stupid simply to embolden the females. The story is a joke and the dialogue is horrible.Hollywood, please stop giving SJWs the reins to how movies should be. They don't make money, and they're constant failures, and the country is suck of them.
Just got out of a 6pm showing Thursday night. Overall disappointing, all the jokes fell flat except 2 where the majority of the audience laughed. The fights are all slow mo where the guy flips, seriously they overdid it. It was just bland. They screwed up Huntress as little as she was in it, they made her a "bro" kinda dimwit.It was just overall bland. I think it'll make money because they're hardcore pushing the girl power all men are bad in the movie but they dropped the ball. OG Suicide Squad is better and that's saying something.






Within just 3 minutes I hated this film. The highpitched voice of Margot Robbie (like Mickey Mouse) just constantly annoying, extreme violence without any need (faces of victims were cut off, leg bones broken by jumping on them etc. - all of that also within just the first 5 minutes of the flick), vomiting, snot, peeing ... it was as if the producers tried to 'shock', annoy and put off the viewers with as many cliches and generally annoying/disgusting/dehumanizing scenes possible. I asked my friends how they like the film - general shaking of heads. We decided that our time is too valuable to watch this crap, gave it 10 minutes more but than left.This is what I call thievery of time and money. Horrible.






First part of the BoP, that feels like 2/3 of the movie, is just bunch of character introduction, flashbacks, retelling stories. The antagonist is lame and boring. Action scene isn't exciting, full of slow-mo scenes, Harley just spins too much it seems unnecessary. Dinah's scream is just out of nowhere.
Birds of PreyI must say I was really bored from the start.What was good,The action sequences were well planned.The stylingWhat was badA paper thin story about of really empty violent criminal that derived pleasure from hurting people. Why is this entertaining.The same scenes kept repeating and repeating it was beyond predictable.Just no character development and some strange pc nod to girl power.I really don't see why this movie was made at all and who was the target audience.






I really wanted to like this movie. Love Margot, love Ewan. So many positive things. Amazing budget, great actors, awesome source material.Still very bad. Actors could not fix this script and plot. Very poor. Wish this was special and not cheapened by typical Hollywood decisions.






Having watched this movie just last night, and having some time to reflect on it, I can honestly say that this movie is not worth the time to watch. The acting is average for the most part, the story is well below average, the whole movie is just average. Not to mention that it hinges on the appeal of all DC Universe fans while at the same time completely aiming directly at teenagers.I didn't have high hope's that Birds of Prey was going to be anything other than an average movie so set my expectations pretty low. This is a Warner Bros movie after all and when it comes to the DC universe, their movie releases are very much like a Yoyo of good to downright awful. But what we get here is a spinoff movie that does nothing to convince you that it was even set in the world of DCU, let alone the world of Batman. Seriously, if you took away the obvious uniqueness of some of the characters, removed their names and called this anything that infers a crime caper, you would never have know. But to make this as painless as possible for those on the fence as to whether they should watch this or not, I can sum this movie up fairly quickly and easily.***Spoiler time***Harley gets dumped.
Harley gets drunk.
Harley tries to go it alone.
Harley becomes a target without the Joker's protection.
Harley gets caught by Roman Sionis (Black Mask) who is after a diamond.
Said diamond is seemingly a key to ruling the criminal underworld.
A kid steals said diamond when she pickpockets Victor Zsasz.
Harley makes a deal to retrieve said diamond to keep herself alive.
Harley finds kid.
Harley feels sorry for kid.
Harley tries to keep kid alive.
Harley keeps kid alive.
Kid kills (gratuitously) Black Mask.
Harley and kid run away with diamond.
The end.***Spoilers end***
I generously gave this a 4/10 purely because some of the visual effects were pretty good, Margot Robbie (Harley), Ewan McGregor (Roman Sionis/Black Mask) and Chris Messina (Victor Zsasz) acting skills were keeping the film alive and some of the action scenes were mildly amusing. Other than that there is nothing really to redeem this movie. Think of Suicide Squad having an (almost) all star cast to keep it mildly entertaining and you will have an idea of the quality, or lack there of, that Birds of Prey has to offer. Which isn't much.
The action scenes weren't complimented by the cinematography, all the characters were very one-sided, there were many small plot holes and generally the violence was really meh. The movie tried many times to be funny and a few times managed it, although without being too cringy the rest of the times. I don't want to hate the movie but it's not that enjoyable to have a good time.






Suicide Squad was a terrible movie, pitiful actually. So why would we watch or like this? Just because people saw suicide squad doesnt mean it was good or that they liked it. This movie looks like a pile of rainbow sherbet, the color scheme alone will repel viewers and the costumes are unrecognizable. I wont get into the feminist aspect because im not allowed...






There are two ways to look at the film - as a stand alone film or as a Harley Quinn film.Getting the latter out of the way, it's not a Harley Quinn film, nor is the awful Suicide Squad. This is a character loosely based on one of the most liked characters in DC comics. But that's not an issue as I don't believe it's meant to be the same character.As a stand alone film, it's ok. It's trying very hard to be Deadpool in many parts and falls flat at that.
It's also not all that fun though it tries desperately hard to be "fun" with the colours and sounds and attempted jokes throughout which in a lot of scenes back fires. Ewan McGregor is also not all that great in the film, it's hard to understand his motive, he seems to have a different motive in every scene.Warner Brothers has completely wasted their own properties with DC Films really, if they make a sequel to this how does it fit with Suicide Squad? Why would they make a sequel to either, the audiences didn't walk out screaming for more, nor or either memorable. Add this to the long list of poor, disconnected DC films, it's a mess.
The saving grace is Wonder Woman which is amazing and deserves better from WB.






But thats the only thing positive i can say about this
Looks like dc needed easy money so they used every graphic fught scene they could, included visual effects from dance movies
No storyline whatsoever
I almost fell asleep in the cinema
Not comparable to well known dc movies like wonderwoman, joker, batman, suicide squad etc
Its really bad






Margot is excellent as Harley Quinn and charming. But for me the film cannot be sustained. And the new characters in the plot didn't interest me. A cliché film, a noisy soundtrack that doesn't fit with the scenes and a plot with nothing to unfold. Some moments even sounds similar to the second Deadpool movie






Another feminist but poorly focused film, which aims to give a message of empowerment by putting all men as unscrupulous bad guys who want to hurt very angry women with no sense of humor, and with the power to beat them up. The same happened with the last version of Charlie's Angeles, but at least there was a more interesting plot and more twists in it.
I believe that the opportunity to create a film that really conveyed the message to young women that feminism is not to be against men, but to seek equal opportunities, was lost. And I emphasize "young women" because for me this film must have been made with teenagers in mind, because it is not only lost in giving radical messages, but in the constant use of the f* word, that evidences more the bad script, as well as in cruel violence that is unnecessary. And also it is a boring movie, which fails to catch me as audience and itself believes to be more important than it is. I don't know why Ewan McGregor's work has been praised, if all he does is interpret the bad bad guy. In fact, his character, like the other Birds of Prey that are not Harley Quinn, has no development and is a stereotype.
At least towards the end there is a good action scene in a car, and Margot Robbie is nice, but too bad she is at the service of such a mediocre film.






There is a "car chase" at about 25mph, a fight in a bouncy castle baseball bats v guns/knives. Disjointed narrative, McGregor is about as intimidating as cornflakes. It doesn't know who it's audience is. Mercifully short.






Margo was AMAZING as Harley! Lit up the screen and impeccable acting, the fight scene were unique and well shot. The rest... BORING! I would much rather have seen a plot about Harley's transformation or her and the jokers relationship... But a girl power movie is just boring! The whole thing was centered around beating up bad guys and how you don't need a man. Just boring in the end... Go woke go broke I guess! It's just sad because the movie was really well done and could've been so fun and awesome but it just had a terrible plot!






BIRDS OF PREY...wtf DID I WATCHED????DON'T THE they KNOW ITS BASED ON COMICS NOT YOUR BITTER DIVORCE ! 10 HOURS OF MY LIFE I WILL NEVER GET BACK.. WELL IT FELT LIKE THAT BLOODY LONG AND BORING ANY WAY.. ps the writer did a great Job writing Bumblebee.. Enjoyed that one ..






I did not like Suicide Squad which might invalidate my opinion for some people, but I feel it's important to add. This film beats it out by miles. I would watch SS a thousand times if it could erase Birds of Prey from my memory. It was awfully paced, poorly acted, irritatingly written, an overall nightmare.If you can enjoy this movie I guess good for you? But I have no idea why someone would walk out of the theater without feeling like you wasted two hours or just being frustrated.






Sorry i went to cinema to watch. Very few good fight scenes. The girls had no chemistry and was awkward. The story telling was a bit annoying.






Hollywood is becoming very tiresome and this garbage doesn't help matters. When are female actors to be be given roles where they do not have to try to out do male physically violent characters ? Not only preposterous a la the last Terminator junk, but here also the endless' we can be tougher than you' rubbish is pumped out as if to show " see we do give women good roles"I know it is easy to blame the screeching of the metoo movement partially for this state of affairs , but please filmakers grow a set and cast women in good roles where they are the best fit and not splatter every film with miss-cast actresss just to try to show that you are being inclusive. Currently the casting is demeaning to absolutely everyone.
Birds of Prey: And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn is a new action crime film from the DC film series. This film is directed by Cathy Yan the director of Dead Pigs.Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) and her partner the Joker split up in the film. Harley now has to stand up single-handedly in the criminal world of Gotham City. When the other criminals learn that Harley is going to live without Joker now, they think they can beat her or use her sooner. The criminal Roman Sionis (Ewan McGregor) is looking for a hidden diamond that contains the details of a hidden loot. The young pickpocket Cassandra Colin (Ella Jay Basco) accidentally comes into possession of the diamond while robbing people, so Roman puts a price on her head. Harley tries to take the diamond from Kassandra in a friendly way, because if someone from Sionis gets hold of her people, they will more brutally take the diamond from the young girl. During the time that Harley and Cassandra spend together, the two paths cross with Sionis former collaborator Black Canary (Jurnee Smollett-Bell), the Mafia fighter Huntress (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) and the agent Renee Montoya (Rosie Perez). The four decide to protect Kassandra and to fight with Sionis and his criminal team.This film was written by Christina Hodson, who, apart from the Sci-FI film Bumblebee, only wrote the scripts of two messy thrillers. The character of Harley Quinn is known to be a bit twisted after the time she spent with the psychopathic Joker. This film is largely told from its point of view, which sometimes makes it seem chaotic in an appropriate way. Unfortunately, this entertaining chaos loses its clarity at some point, making the film seem too messy and more and more difficult to follow. The story jumps from the now with flashbacks to the past. Switches between the storylines of the different characters in a difficult to follow manner. Or the storylines are told unnecessarily in a long-winded way. With a better script or a co-writer they could have had a better end result where the story would have been a bit smoother and they had paid more attention to the details. Christina Hodson is also scheduled as a writer for two new future DC films in the DC film series, but it is better to schedule a co-writer for clearer scrips.
The film is also too feminist, because all male characters are portrayed as villains or weak idiots. The fight scenes are well portrayed, but lack real excitement, because the female characters always know how to defeat their male opponents too easily. In combat, for example, male opponents never use their weapons or arrive too late, which means that these scenes do not appear realistic.Margot Robbie came up with the idea for this film and had it made in consultation with the film studio and DC. Margot Robbie is also one of the producers of this film and now wanted to show her Harley Quinn character in her own way in this film. Birds of Prey is also the title of a DC comic series, but this film is not exactly the same as this series, because the film is actually more about the character of Harley Quinn. This way she manages to portray her role in a good and personal way, but she also has to do it with less script. The rest of the cast is given a little less time to develop their characters in the film or to present them well. You can see their background information in a hurry in flashbacks. It can be seen that Ewan McGregor had fun filming this film, because in his scenes he comes across as the villain of the story. Unfortunately, he seems a bit too exaggerated at the end and cannot be taken seriously any more at a time.






Caught the late morning showing of this film with the family as we all loved Margot Robbie as Harley in the Suicide Squad film and everyone came away hating this movie. The story was very uninspiring, the violence and fight scenes with a couple of exceptions were poorly done and it simply skipped around too damn much trying to explain it's terrible story.The half dozen others who were in the theater were obviously as disappointed as we were from their very loud comments while leaving pointing out obvious flaws with the canon of Harley and her power set in being tranquilized so easily when she is virtually immune to toxins and chemicals ( I had to look it up make sure they were right and they were).Whether all of its flaws are the result of the usual studio interference of the DC movies or because Robbie was a producer of the movie is for others to determine. All I really know is this was one of the few times I can really say the cost of going in time and money was a complete waste.
Sorry, but i absolutely hated it! A really bad comedy for kids.






The movie was unforgettable, thought it would get better it just got stale. The script is terrible, every aspect of the movie failed to deliver. If it was not for Margot Robbie doing a good job playing Harley Quinn. I would of walked out of the theater. Don't believe the hype skip this one!






I WAS REALLY HOPING I'D LIKE THIS BUT I ENJOYED MY MICRO NAPS DURING THE FILM BETTER... THE STORY LINE IS ALL OVER THE PLACE AND THE CHARACTERS ARE UNLIKABLE WITH THE EXCEPTION OF HQ... UNFORTUNATELY THE ONLY PREY IN THIS MESS WAS ME






I was really hoping to have a good time. Instead, when I wasn't winching from the language I was reeling from the violence. It is unnecessarily disturbing. Not exactly graphic but considering my 11 year old daughter was really waiting to see this movie-that ain't gonna happen-it's needlessly gruesome. This movie is too silly to take seriously and too serious to politely excuse as "it's just a movie, lighten up!" Almost everyone is horribly miscast except Margot Robbie. She's great! The writing is bad. The sets are bad! Man, the clothing is even bad, and I never notice such things. The villain (I won't say his name) from the comic book has been emasculated to the point of being more insulting than threatening. The implication is that he's a gay, psychopathic killer; if that's true someone at DC needs to learn how to make their gay psychopaths more ruthless (they missed the mark on Lex Luther in Batman vs Superman too). I'm sure should you see this objectively you'll find way more bad stuff to criticize than me.






I wasn't drawn into the story nor felt connected to any of the characters. All of the characters portrayed lacked substance and depth as did the overall plot. It all seemed like a bunch of caricatures moving things across a drawn out, boring, no surprises script. The lead character is portrayed as shallow, having gone looney over her falling in love with the Joker. The back story of her life doesn't add up to where she ends up in present time - stealing, killing, anarachist. The other characters pop up as anti-hero's but again a lack of depth and no back story other than the Black Canary to give a sense of connection to their motives. The scene where the BC lets her vocals loose and exhibits a super power comes out of nowhere and only happens once. I still don't understand how she got that power but maybe the editing took out that part. Overall, I felt as if I wasted two hours of precious time, and unless you are a die-hard Harley fan, I highly recommend avoiding this movie.
I am a huge fan of Suicide Squad and Margot nailed Harley Quinn. So if Barb Wire and a really bad circus had a baby it would be Birds of Prey. The cast had no magic and the fight scenes were just plain ridiculous. I know this wasn't supposed to be an academy award movie but I expected a lot more from the writers and directors. Save your money and if your really bored and are tired watching grass grow rent it and watch it while you play on your IPad. Sorry, Margot save your career and stay away from any sequels down this road.






I made an account just to write this review. I gave the extra star because the tin can the popcorn came in was the highlight of the movie for design and colour.
As for the movie, truly abysmal, complete and utter waste of time. Unmitigating and utter shambles of a story line and very uninspired to say the least. I am truly traumatised from ever going to the cinema again!






I am not sure what is this movie. Sort of a suicide squad, but even worse, mixed with joker. All the movie could be summarized in two ideas: Margot Robbie and the boring woke message "all men are bad". A movie for the glory of Margot, in which all the other characters are mere plain comparsas. And, in this sense, it works: Margot Robbie is good, she do it very well and she is all the movie. She is fantastic.
The villain here are all the men. Period. McGregor do it well as a well trained mercenary of acting.
The female supremacy messages are beginning to be tiresome, folks. I didn't remember Ripley or Connor needed to highlight their badassness in an overall men sucks ideology.
Apart of that message (which is not as exaggerated as some say in their comments, but it is there) the movie is formulaic, predictable, messy and, probably one of the worst DC movies...
If you are a woke teenager in the age range 12-19 years, probably you will deeply enjoy it. If you are a fan of DC comics, you will see how far is this Harley Quinn from the comics, but you will enjoy the few coincidences. If you like DC movies, maybe you will enjoy it with a lot of popcorn. If you do not feel identified by any of these categories, save your time and money.






Seriously cant think of anything good to say about this movie. action scenes looked badly staged. plot is paper thin. this continued pandering to the woke left has killed what had the potential to be truely awesome movie. sure i get its good to be diverse and all inclusive be its continually being forced down out throats and only alienates those of us who just want to escape for a couple of hours and want to be entertained. this fails on every front






Women against men, men are evil, women, the good, wins.
I was one of the few people who liked Suicide Squad. And sure there won't be a Will Smith Deadshot again.. or the awesome El Diablo. For that matter, this film has no Batman or Joker. The characters are all brought together quickly/ in a rush but oh well. Harley Quinn gets annoying. And fast. Even from the opening sequence I was already wishing for less of her. So to give you something that seems like praise- If Joker was a ONE then this is a FOUR. Still wouldn't watch it again.






What happens when you keep shilling for the idiotic woke narrative only regressive degenerates enjoy? This move, among many others, does. Bland, boring and ridiculous in the worst of ways.






2 hours of terrible fighting scenes and some of the worst comedy in a movie from the past 20 years. They never should've released it...






Why does Hollywood feel they are responsible for teaching, preaching would actually work better, us how we should think, act, and behave.This is basically Charlie's Angles with hotter actresses and better acting. But it's the same plot, men evil, women good.For me, it's getting boorish.Margo Robbie is awesome, I think she will have a special career worthy of remembrance some day, but it won't be for this. This will be a 'Oh My God, I know' moment when she is doing a retrospective interview 30 years from now.






Another 'super' flop! I had low expectations from the trailers and the movie met them. Another softening of DC, story and action where both clunky. Not funny enough, not violent enough and not enough of a story line. What a waste of good actors and good DC characters.






Just a total mess of a film,bad script
no real story ,bad acting ,the wrong actors for some of the parts, no real jokes in the film,some ok action bits but the films just all over the place it was terrible.has to be the worst D C film to date .






Its just as the trailer looked like ... a wannabe deadpool. Only good thing ist Margot's performance.
A missed chance...






I think DC were hoping for a female Dead Pool, but from casting onwards this film is just a mess. Ewan McGregor is just so bad he should hand back the pay cheque. The rest aren't much better.
